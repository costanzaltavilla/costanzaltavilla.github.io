      <description>Hello guys,
After some days went past I will now sum up the main events of the CLT 2016 for you.
The event took place from 19th - 20th March at Technische Universit√§t of Chemnitz. This year the team was smaller than the years before and only Thomas Faber and me (for ppl that don&#39;t know me: Daniel Reimer) have made it. The hotel we booked was the Hoteloper Chemnitz. Tryin to stay sort of cheap we had a two bed room in deluxe size (at least one of two guys in that team could kill with the noise he makes @ night ^^).</description>

He&#39;s pretty much given up on writing NTVDM sound card drivers for now due to licensing problems he can&#39;t bypass and/or combine with his ideals.</description>

Proceedings Meeting started at 19:18 by Aleksey Bragin
 Point 1: Status Reports Point 2: 0.4.0 Release plans  Point 1: Status Reports [TheFlash]: He started working on the NTVDM Sound Blaster emulation, however he realized that he&#39;s completely unable to test anything sound-related on ReactOS. KVM doesn&#39;t support the only card we have (CMI8378) and the rest would require non-free drivers, the use of which he finds contradictory to his ideals.</description>

 Point 1: Status Reports Point 2: Hackfest  Point 1 Aleksey Bragin: His work on LDR code starts to have good results and a first patch was attached to a JIRA ticket.

      <description>The Chemnitz Linux-Days 2010 are over and all ReactOS developers have safely made their way home again.
We would like to give a summary, and share our impressions with those who were unfortunately unable join us:
Contrary to our expectations, the stall and the presentation were a wow. Especially for ReactOS Deutschland e.V., the new German non-profit organization supporting the project, it was a promising start. A lot of interested guests visited our stall and wished us success for the future.</description>
