      <description>ReactOS 0.3.9 Released  Our development team is pleased to announce the 9th increment of the 0.3 series of ReactOS, an open source WindowsÂ® compatible operating system.  As we draw ever closer to the 0.4 series, more and more work is being put into bugfixing existing code in an effort to get more applications and drivers working. This release is testament to that and is our most compatible release to date.</description>

      <description>On 05th and 06th October, ReactOS attended Linux World Expo UK as part of the .Org village. The two representatives for the project were Ge van Geldorp and Ged Murphy.

Equipment for the exhibition consisted of 3 laptops, one running ReactOS on real hardware, one running ReactOS in VMWare and a laptop to act as an internet gateway. We also had around 100 live CDs and 400 flyers.
Unfortunately we had trouble holding a connection to the AP due to a weak signal, so couldn&#39;t report in real-time.</description>
