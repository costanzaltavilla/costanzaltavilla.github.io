      <title>GSoC 2018 - Final report</title>

      <description>Introduction WinBtrfs is a feature-complete IFSD (Installable File System Driver) for NT operating systems, written by Mark Harmstone. This driver is checked into the ReactOS source code for some time already. My main goal for this GSoC project was to implement all missing features (and fix bugs, of course) in ReactOS that prevents booting from BTRFS file system.
Links All work is merged into gsoc2018_all branch in my ReactOS fork on GitHub.</description>

      <description>Hi, all!
Here is what happened since last post:
Freeloader is now able to read files and follow symlinks from btrfs partition. One major issue is left here - case sensitivity. BTRFS is case-sensitive file system, so paths like /ReactOS/System32, /reactos/system32, /ReactOS/system32 are different here. But in Windows world most software is written assuming that case does not matter during path lookup. This thing is solved in WinBtrfs driver, but for Freeloader it can be a bit tricky.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.9, the latest in our accelerated cadence targeting a release every three months.
While a consequence of this faster cycle might mean fewer headliner changes, much of the visible effort nowadays comes in the form of quality-of-life improvements in how ReactOS functions. At the same time work continues on the underlying systems which provide more subtle improvements such as greater system stability and general consistency.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
 Sorry, haven’t written anything for a while. Let me tell you what have been done since last post. BTRFS boot sector TL;DR: It works!
 I’ve been able to load main bootloader code from freeldr.sys into memory, transfer control to it and get on error message (freeldr.sys can’t find its config file - I haven’t written second-stage BTRFS code yet).  It was not that easy because we are in x86 real mode when running boot sector thus only about 1mb of memory is available.</description>

      <description>Today, the ReactOS Website has been migrated to a new Login system and all components have been upgraded to their latest versions.
In the course of that, the user database has also been moved and cleaned from accounts that have never been used.
Such large migrations hardly go without issues, so if you notice anything wrong, please report a bug in our JIRA bugtracker.
You are also advised to change your password in the Self-Service, even if it&#39;s just to the same one.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
This two weeks I was diving into btrfs structures and on-disk layout. Writing an ASM program from scratch is not that simple so I decided to convert a VirtualBox image with BTRFS filesystem in it to raw file and write a python script to parse and show internal filesystem structures.  It was also useful for understanding how files are stored in FS, because information on btrfs.wiki.kernel.org was not enough for me to understand some corner cases.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hi all!
My name is Victor Perevertkin and I am the only GSoC student in ReactOS project this year :)
This is my first GSoC and I was very excited when I realized that I was selected and there will be four mentors for me. I will definitely learn a lot from this internship!
My project is both simple and complicated. I want to add to ReactOS an option to install on and boot from BTRFS partitions.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.8 as we continue to work on releasing every three months.
As you may know, our previous 0.4.7 version was the first one developed in our Git/GitHub repository. 0.4.8 is the nice sequel and a good way to measure the GitHub impact on the ReactOS project. Since ReactOS reached GitHub, it has been forked 248 times. A nice amount understanding ReactOS is not a framework or a library, but a final product.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.7 as we continue to work on releasing every three months.
We’re especially pleased to present this release as the very first one that’s been developed in our new Git/GitHub repository. Moving from Subversion to GitHub has proven to be an invaluable way to reach new testers, users and improve the overall awareness of the ReactOS project.
To highlight the impact we’ve had since we moved to GitHub two months ago, ReactOS now leads the Win32Api and OsDev categories in Github, overtaking many amazing and well established projects.</description>

      <description>Today, the ReactOS Source Code has been migrated from a central Subversion instance to a decentralized Git repository. Together with that, ReactOS joins the list of projects using the popular GitHub service for developing software. We expect that this move greatly improves the way we collaborate on ReactOS development and reduces the barriers for newcomers. Just fork our repository on GitHub, commit your changes and send us a Pull Request!</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to release version 0.4.6 as a continuation of its three month cadence. 0.4.6 is a major step towards real hardware support. Several dual boot issues have been fixed and now partitions are managed in a safer way avoiding corruption of the partition list structures. ReactOS Loader can now load custom kernels and HALs. Printing Subsystem is still greenish in 0.4.6, however Colin Finck has implemented a huge number of new APIs and fixed some of the bugs reported and detected by the ReactOS automated tests.</description>

      <description>Introduction ReactOS App Manager (RAPPS) is an app used in ReactOS to download apps, tested by ReactOS team and community. It also manages apps that are installed - you can view apps that are present on your system and uninstall them. The goal of this project was to improve RAPPS and add some very useful features.
Here is a video presenting it&#39;s features:

      <description>Finally the driver is generating multiple interrupt without any issues. Whenever a device is connected or disconnected an interrupt is being generated. In windows 2003 server edition, when a device is attached windows is recognizing that some unknown device is attached and also in the device manager we can see attached devices though they are not initiated.

This is a crucial step, as now any USB device can be safely initiated.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! 0/
Tick-Tock is coming to an end, and the next week is perhaps the last week of coding before final evaluation starts! ;P But let&#39;s be calm and discuss what happened last week. And as promised, I managed to get some demonstrable snaps this time. So, here we go!
As told in my last blog, we got some flashy new icons for the stobject modules I worked on. The above pic shows the battery in charging mode.</description>

      <description>Last week went pretty well! :)
In my last post, I talked about how I needed to refactor some code to fix a bug. I&#39;m really happy with how this turned out.
Refactoring As I mentioned before, the driver has a struct called an NTFS_ATTR_CONTEXT which keeps track of information related to attributes. The main purpose of the structure is to keep vital information about the attribute cached in memory, but it&#39;s also just a convenient way to pass information about attributes between functions and the driver relies on it quite extensively.</description>

      <description>Recently I’ve worked on Scratchpad allocation. Scratchpad buffers are PAGESIZE blocks of system memory which the xHCI uses to store its internal state. xHCI can request 0 to 1024 buffers. Number of buffers required is given in the HCSPARAMS1 register. Each buffer is a PAGESIZE block aligned to PAGESIZE boundary.

Scratchpad buffer array is an array which contains addresses of the scratchpad buffers. Its size is equal to the number of maximum scratchpad buffers required by the hardware.</description>

      <description>Hey there, its Shriraj here! 0/
We are already in week 9 of this 12-week journey of GSoC! Soon about to take the final lap, but wait we have a lot to do before that. This time too I don&#39;t have any pics as such to show visible progress, but yeah let&#39;s see through words what I managed to do last week. ;P
What I did Last week? As I told in my last blog, we are currently working to find the appropriate enumeration filters required for safely removable devices, but as that feature is being tested on a standalone console app, I was free to prepare the stobject of ReactOS to welcome the hotplug!</description>

      <description>Hello World!
I know it hasn&#39;t been very long since the last update. The last few updates were late, but I&#39;m trying to get back into good habits like committing often and blogging on time. :)
Last time, I talked about how ReactOS was corrupting my test volume by trying to create files I wasn&#39;t ready for it to create. I was indeed able to fix that by booting into Windows and creating the folder and files ReactOS kept trying to make.</description>

Sorry for posting my blog late this time :P. Was kinda busy with my family duties, besides some errands. Also, my college is starting from this week. As devs, we are better coders than writers but yeah, as a GSoC norm, blogging is a healthy habit which keeps us updated. ;)
About this phase Let&#39;s keep it short this time, as I told in my last blog we are officially in the final phase of the project.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone! Last week I left off with an example of creating files, showing you how an index node fills up with file names. Once the node in a B-Tree gets too full, it needs to be split. I&#39;ve been working on this for a while and I was expecting that I&#39;d have an example of this working. I even delayed writing this post because I was so sure this feature was almost ready.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s very good when things go as planned. And they do! The BULK INSTALL&amp;nbsp;is here! Let&#39;s have a look.

 Checkboxes are useful Now you can select a bunch of apps in the app bar. In the statusbar you can see selected app count. Selection drops when the categories are switched.
&amp;nbsp;Using &#34;Select/Deselect button&#34; will select all apps in the current view.
&amp;nbsp;Install all apps at once Pressing &#34;Install&#34; while there is a checkbox selection will open a download dialog.</description>

      <description>In this post I’m going to detail my work progress. In the past week I’ve decided to clean up the code. Some parts of the code was re-written as functions. After that I’ve started working on the USB port status function. When an interrupt is generated the code is getting stuck in a loop.  I’m trying to figure out what caused it.

As we’ve discussed in the previous blog post.</description>

      <description>Hello again! :)
Last week, I finished the code that writes a B-Tree node to disk. Specifically, it lets me write the node to an index buffer within the index allocation of the parent directory. Don&#39;t worry if that doesn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;ll explain it more below.
From a user&#39;s perspective, this means that the driver now has the ability to create dozens of files. My tester will create 39 files before filling the index node.</description>

Before we start, I have an anouncement: I&#39;m going to Hackfest and FroSCon this August! I may not be very useful there, but I can discuss things related to the project, meet my mentor Mark Jansen and other devs. I will also learn from the ReactOS developers and FrOSCon workshops. &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>xHC functioning mostly depends on different ring data structures. In this blog post I’m going to detail what a ring is in XHCI and various implementations by Linux and Haiku. 
A ring is a circular queue of data structures. There are three kinds of rings in xHC. 
1.	Command ring
2.	Event Ring
3.	Transfer Ring

These rings are the basis of communication with the Controller. Command Ring is used to send commands to the controller.</description>

      <description>Hey, guys!
Six weeks have passed since I started my journey of coding with ReactOS. It was a wonderful time full of learning, coding, and fun. In terms of productivity, this week was not that great as compared to weeks before. But I can say it was an essential decision making and learning week. So I started this week, by resuming the task of patching up the remaining issues of CR-122.</description>

      <description>Last week I got back to writing B-Tree code. Sadly, the week flew by before I could come up with anything screenshot-able.

I&#39;ve been updating the B-Tree code to accommodate index allocations, and trees of arbitrary depth. I&#39;m mostly done with this but I still have to finish the code that saves an index buffer to the index allocation. Once I do that, I should be able to demonstrate creating dozens of files in a directory.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my third blog post.  Sorry for the missed blog post from last week. I was stuck over an issue which kept me occupied. With the help of community I finally got over it. I had to calculate an address by adding a value taken from another register to the base address. This led to a typecast issue. Due to huge number of steps required to generate interrupt I didn&#39;t suspect the problem to be where it is initially.</description>

Last time you must have seen some snapshots of where the QuickLaunch has reached. Seeing the UI and some functionalities in the snaps must have given you a feeling that it&#39;s complete and finished. But, Nah... a lot of work is left, besides debugging so that Dr. Watson would finally be free of his postmortems!! XP

      <description>I won&#39;t lie; it&#39;s been a slow week, feature-wise.
I guess you could say that last week was all about finding and fixing bugs and errors with the driver. During the first half of the week, I upgraded my automated tester to test file creation, and I fixed a couple of bugs it turned up. I used the second half of the week for addressing issues raised by CR-123.
Automated Test I tried to go all out with the tester.</description>

This week I was working on refactoring the code and improving code. This will help me progress faster and addd new feature more easily. It is not the only reason: RAPPS was initially written in C and had been converted to C++.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone!! So you all are still with me? Good!! ;)
As I had told last week, that this week will be rather an exciting one, and yes it indeed was. And the reason is, finally, you all will see a working (prototype) of the quick launch band. (yay!!) Let me go through chronologically, what I did this week. The first thing was to Implement the IShellFolderBand. This is a very important interface as it helps to initialize the IShellFolder and PIDL (via its InitializeSFB method) required to enumerate the folder objects.</description>

      <description>All continues to go well :). Two weeks ago, I started writing code to parse B-Trees, which are representative of how NTFS organizes its directories on disk.
It works like this: First, the index of a directory is read and converted to a B-Tree in memory. Next, a key for the new file is inserted into the tree. Finally, the tree is converted back to an index root attribute which is written to disk.</description>

      <description>In this post I’m going to give some details on the working of xHC along with my progress. In my opinion Driver development is for the most part thoroughly studying the documentation. I’m working towards my next major target i.e., Implementing Control transfer. In this process I’ve faced some unforeseen issues. From the previous USB models and the available driver code my estimates of xHC turned out to be inadequate. xHC uses various kinds or data structures, more than what the other HC’s use.</description>

So far, so good!! No blockers and nothing to worry about, and just being around reactos community is pure fun. Coming straight to the point, this week I continued what I had left last time and that was the james band... err.. i mean CISFBand!! XP
After forwarding the methods of the built in system CISFBand and testing its integrity within live virtual machine, the next thing to do was to replace this system CISFBand with my own implementation of it.</description>

Last two weeks was extrodinary hard - university work took all the time. Fortunately it was dealt with and I&#39;m working at full capacity. I don&#39;t like to write stories in the blog so I&#39;ll keep this blog short and informative. And with screenshots!
Changes During this 3 weeks I&#39;ve made some changes to visual part and to the RAPPS DB.</description>

      <description>All is going well :). Since the last update, I&#39;ve checked off a minor TODO related to file creation: increasing the size of the master file table, if needed.

Every time the mft grows, it creates several empty file records at a time. In the past, I was using this to my advantage, and was only creating files in empty slots that already existed. Every time I got an error saying there wasn&#39;t enough space for a new file, I&#39;d boot into Windows, create a file (which would increase the mft size), and get back to testing.</description>

      <description>This blog post is first one of a series of posts which will deal with various topics related to xHCI (usb 3.0). I&#39;m Rama Teja one of the participants in GSOC 2017. My project is to develop xHCI driver for ReactOS with the help of my mentor Thomas Faber. In the xHCI documentation given by Intel there are three major topics i.e., Register Interface, Data Structures and Operational model. The hardware controller&#39;s register interface is used to send commands to it or get the status etc.</description>

      <description>Hello friends, its Shriraj again. ;)
Its already second week of the coding period, and I was enjoying my time as a beginner dev in reactos. Learning new things every now and then and just being on irc is a sheer fun. So as decided last time, we had an official gsoc meeting on #reactos-gsoc. I explained and summarized what I was able to do last week. Also planned what Ill be doing next.</description>

      <description>Hi, its me Shriraj. :)
This is my second blog on my GSoC project TSE(Taskbar Shell Extension).
So, finally coding period began, and I was excited enough to pump out some code boiling within my mind! Sir Giannis (aka gadamopoulos) and Sir Sylvain (aka sdever) are my mentors in this project. In this first week, basically mentor Giannis showed me how to step into this huge codebase of reactos and helped me to get started by providing the canvas for my code.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! My name is Trevor Thompson. I&#39;m a computer science major at Blue Ridge Community College living in Virginia. This is my second time participating in Google Summer of Code. I&#39;m very happy to be working on ReactOS&#39; NTFS driver again!
Recap When I started last year, ReactOS could read files from an NTFS volume, but had no write support whatsoever. After GSoC last year, the driver in my branch could overwrite existing files.</description>

I am not just studying CSE but I like to play and experiment with CSE. Programming is just another hobby and I knew that its one of my forte the moment I had felt my first &#39;Hello World!!&#39; with &#39;C&#39;. (OK, that might be a little exaggeration XD, but yeah you can tell it when you start enjoying the subject so much that you felt code is better art than a poem.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to release version 0.4.5 as a continuation of its three month cadence. Beyond the usual range of bug fixes and syncs with external dependencies, a fair amount of effort has gone into the graphical subsystem. Thanks to the work of Katayama Hirofumi and Mark Jansen, ReactOS now better serves requests for fonts and font metrics, leading to an improved rendering of applications and a more pleasant user experience.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, I&#39;m summarizing here my latest progress towards making Word 2010 running in ReactOS.  After having paused a little my ReactOS development during the first two weeks of February (due to personal matters), I started reviewing Samuel Serapión&#39;s NTLM code (in the &#34;sspi-bringup&#34; branch) and first focused on trying to convert his NTLM tests into something that can be included into our apitest framework. This is still work-in-progress because his original tests are interactive, and I need to find the good way of turning them into automated tests and finding a way to store the test results (for comparison purposes), as the tests are modeled around a client/server architecture.</description>

First two weeks of January (until ~= 15)  In my previous report of last time, I explained that what blocked my progress on Word 2010 was the absence of NTLM authentication support for the installation to continue &amp; finish.</description>

Many of you will recall that Giannis was one of the developers heavily responsible for getting the explorer-new shell into trunk, working extensively on the shell32 library that it depended upon. The objective of his current appointment is also shell related, and is specifically to work out the remaining issues in proper theme support, an oft requested feature by the community and one of the milestones of the Community Edition distribution.</description>

 During the second half of last month (December) I did not have much time to work on ReactOS, hence the fact I could not write more reports for you to read. I was however able to test some stuff I started to work on during last November. I have started to familiarize and play a bit with the user-profile APIs inside userenv.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody. Today I am going to summarize my progress on Word 2010 installation so far, concerning the main two problems I did encounter: setting a correct environment block for services, and understanding why the SLInitialize function fails, leading to the failure of the Word 2010 installation. The third problem, namely correctly stopping services, will be addressed in a subsequent report. Reading the two previous weekly reports: &#34;Part 1: Installation&#34;</description>

      <description>In this second report I continue my investigations on the Word 2010 installation. Last time we saw that our services (and in particular the &#34;Office Software Protection Platform&#34; OSPPSVC service) were started without a complete environment block, and as a result some needed environment variables were missing, causing e.g. OSPPSVC to fail opening some of its files. We now analyse what happens after my local fix (NOTE: I have not committed the fix yet, as I validate it in my local installation first).</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, I am Hermès Bélusca-Maïto. This is my first week report, as part of the part-time scholarship that I started two weeks ago, that consists in making ReactOS being able to support Word 2010.  Preliminaries  Before starting anything with Word 2010 I needed to prepare a testing environment. Because I am a native Windows user, I use a ReactOS trunk build made with the MSVC compiler. This ReactOS build was then properly installed and adequately configured on a VirtualBox (VBox) virtual machine (VM).</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of another incremental update, version 0.4.3. This would be fourth such release the project has made this year, an indication we hope of the steady progress that we have made. Approximately 342 issues were resolved since the release of 0.4.2, with the oldest dating all the way back to 2006 involving text alignment.
Notable in this release is the switching to a new winsock library that had been started several years ago by Alex Ionescu and imported into trunk by Ged Murphy.</description>

Although the IGG campaign was not a success, we were really proud of raising half of the needed funds. Nonetheless, and thanks to your valuable contributions, it was the most successful crowdfunding campaigns ReactOS has ever had.
The IGG crowdfunding impact, your impact, on ReactOS is quite noticeable: A whole reworked shell thanks to hiring Giannis Adamopoulos then David Quintana (who among us misses the old shell!</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been a long but ultimately rewarding journey to the completion of Google Summer of Code 2016 for the ReactOS Project. As a project that seeks to implement an open source operating system based off of the NT architecture and compatible with both NT device drivers and Win32 applications, ReactOS faces some rather distinct challenges compared to other open source OS projects. With an emphasis on compatibility and familiarity, interest in the project has increased substantially after the major revamps the other family of NT operating systems has underwent over the past few years.</description>

      <description>Hi all! This is my first blog post designed to shed some light on the foundation behind ReactOS.
Just like many other big Open-Source projects, ReactOS is backed by a foundation supporting the project financially and organizationally. I have been the treasurer of ReactOS Deutschland e.V. since its establishment in 2009 and as such, it has been my duty to do the tedious accounting of all donations. While most of that is happening in the background, you see the results from time to time when I update the public Donors page.</description>

      <description>My Google Summer of Code project proposal stated that I would add TCP support to the network branch of ReactOS, which sought to integrate lwIP 1.4.1 as the protocol level network driver for the operating system, to ultimately be tested by replacing the network driver in an installation of Windows Server 2003 with my driver. The full proposal can be found here. At the time of my proposal, I underestimated the amount of effort a fully working network driver would take.</description>

      <description>This is a detailed summary of the work I&#39;ve performed during GSoC.
Highlights  Wrote numerous functions which allow for NTFS write-support. Expanded ReactOS&#39; NTFS driver with the ability to overwrite files and change a file&#39;s size. Identified and repaired several bugs related to reading files from NTFS. Fixed ReactOS&#39; LargeMCB implementation, facilitating support for four file systems, NTFS included (See CORE-11002). Diagnosed and fixed a regression using log files (See CORE-11707).</description>

      <description>In this final week, I tried to do as much as possible to get my driver to some sort of usable state for simple network C programs.&amp;nbsp;
My first task this week was to fix a problem with port freeing. When a TCP connection dies, its lwIP PCB would sometimes remain, preventing new sockets from binding to the ports they are taking up. After a lot of tracing, I discovered that an lwIP internal semantic was at play.</description>

      <description>I said in my last update that I was aware GSoC was coming to an end, but in truth I don&#39;t think I realized just how close the end was coming. I need to be completely finished in much less than a week from now!
Near the middle of the week, I was mostly finished with the code to create a new file record in memory. This progressed quickly, thanks to the time I put into diagnostic output and researching the file records that Windows creates.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.4.2, again within three months of the previous release. The team sincerely hopes that this new rapid release cycle will hold for future releases as well. If there is one word to describe progress on the project, it would be steady. The project is reaching a point where rapid releases are viable, where disruption from introduction of major components or restructuring has been greatly reduced from the tumultuous early years and even as recently as the late 0.</description>

      <description>In week 10, I had completed a major rewrite of my driver. In week 11, I dove into the problem of lwIP not being thread-safe once again. While I was able to deal with most of the individual bugs that kept popping up, each one was taking me more time to solve due to the haphazard nature of my previous fixes. At the beginning of last week, it was quickly becoming more apparent that I would need to rework most of my code once again if I wanted to have any hope of circumventing the multithreeading issue once and for all.</description>

      <description>Probably one of the funniest moments while developing is when you realize that something that &#34;looks easy&#34; is not as straight forward as it seemed at first sight.
The task was &#34;really easy&#34;: Just creating a console app which (1)loops infinitely, (2)doing some tasks and (3) which breaks when the user decides to stop it (4)printing some valuable info before exiting.
&#34;Naaah, this is easy. I just need a while/for/do-while/whatever infinite loop, a printf message asking the user to press a specific key to stop it, then a getch() to capture the key in order to break/stop the loop, and finally another printf to print the valuable info: PROFIT!</description>

      <description>I spent last week moving from 2k3 to ROS. After doing final validation of my usbhub changes on 2k3, me and my mentor decided to move to some real world issues. I have setup my development and testing environment work with ROS instead of 2k3.
VS-2015 as IDE for ROS First of all, I decided to use VS as IDE, to be able to use windbg as debugger. In that case I’ll have minimal changes on workflow I was using on 2k3 before.</description>

      <description>This past week, I have primarily focused on thread-safety.&amp;nbsp;
Three weeks ago, I discovered that lwIP&#39;s core code is not thread-safe. When left unmodified, each lwIP thread will access several unprotected global linked lists as well as use a set of global variables to process any and all incoming packets. One option to solve this problem was to modify the core code so the global data was protected from concurrent access.</description>

      <description>Wow, these weeks keep blazing by! Apologies for the missed updates; I&#39;ve been faced with a family emergency for the past couple of weeks. My girlfriend&#39;s dad was in the hospital for 13 days after having a heart attack, getting a triple-bypass, then suffering from Ogilvie syndrome after surgery. He got out Saturday and is recovering. It&#39;s been a very long, scary time for my girlfriend and her family and she needed my support full-time.</description>

      <description>Since previous post I have done few tasks and learned a lot of things. Generally, I was reading and thinking about WDM’s PnP handling concepts. In general, I’ve improved my understanding of PnP and also learned about remove synchronization. Also I’ve investigated some corner cases and problems of WDM related remove synchronization topic. I think this learning is definitely a big investment into my future as NT driver developer.
Interesting thing with DV’s Enhanced I/O Verification Here I have faced few issues which was not seen without Enhanced I/O Verification flag set.</description>

      <description>Having rewritten all of the functions that I implemented and modified some of the functions that already existed before I started on this project at the end of last week, I now had to start flushing all of the bugs that invariably exist after a rewrite.&amp;nbsp;
The major issue I dealt with this past week revolved around properly handling a TDI_LISTEN.&amp;nbsp;
Part of the purpose for the rewrite was to reorganize my data so each TCP_CONTEXT struct represented a user socket or connection endpoint, and each ADDRESS_FILE struct only represented a local network address.</description>

      <description>Last week ended with my realization that lwIP was not thread-safe, and me reading up on various ways to get around that.&amp;nbsp;
Last weekend, I spent a lot of time tinkering with lwIP&#39;s core code to see how hard it would be to make it thread-safe. I ultimately failed to actually make the library thread-safe, but I did learn a lot of things about lwIP that I hadn&#39;t known before I started digging into the source code in so much depth.</description>

      <description>Overwriting Files Continues This week has been pretty uneventful. I wrote a function to shrink the allocation size of an attribute and another to migrate a resident attribute to non-resident. The former seems to be working, the latter still needs some work. Looking Forward (Changing Direction) I&#39;m only planning to spend another couple of days working on updating files, then I want to move on to file creation. There are several reasons motivating this thinking.</description>

      <description>This past week started with me mindlessly chasing down memory bugs after having gotten WinDBG up and running. A particularly annoying bug involved an lwIP protocol control block being dereferenced by lwIP after it had been freed. I could not find a place in my drivere where I tried to use a dead PCB pointer, so I looked deeper. I did some stepping through of code, and read more of lwIP&#39;s source code.</description>

      <description>I have spent this week on improvements of realization and done stability fixes in usbhub PDO/FDO. &amp;nbsp; I have prepared usbhub FDO&#39;s handling of removal and surprise-removal IRPs. We&#39;ll receive surprise-removal IRP on HUB unexpected removal, or on USB controller removal from PCI port. Here hub should &#34;let know&#34; all its children that their parent is removed and on next removal they also can be removed. For now this code path can&#39;t be tested because none of our host controllers can be removed now(they are failing query remove).</description>

      <description>Assigning Clusters Part 2 I can&#39;t believe week seven has already passed! Adding assigned clusters to data runs turned out to be more challenging than I anticipated, but I made steady progress on it throughout the week and have it working now (as far as I can tell). Fixing the problems with LargeMcb.c in week 1 came full-circle, as I relied on a map control block to simplify my task considerably.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ll start this report from the good news. After starting GSoC&#39;s coding period, I was doing fixes and improvements of hub layer and was not repeating tests which was done by me in community bonding period (results provided in my first blog post). So by the end of this week I decided to test surprise-removal on VBox with 2k3 working with our USB stack. As result I saw that crashes on device removal (physical) are gone!</description>

      <description>Last week ended with Art going through decompiled assembly to find a bug for me, because the stack trace in the kernel debugger was pointing me to the wrong line in the C source code. It turns out that the problem was a NULL pointer dereference in the RECEIVE callback. As always in programming, a lot of effort went into catching a small oversight.&amp;nbsp;
With that leftover bug from last week resolved, I moved on to my tasks for this week - more debugging, a code review done by Thomas Faber, and finally setting up WinDBG.</description>

      <description>This week was rewarding, because I got some things done that I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to do for a while.
Assigning ClustersI wrote some code which can assign clusters by updating the $BITMAP file. As I mentioned last week, this is half of the equation for extending the allocation size of a non-resident file. I&amp;#39;m still working on the other half, which involves storing the assigned clusters in data runs.
Resident EvalI realized that modifying the data runs would involve making the same changes I needed for resident attributes, so I focused on making these changes during the second half of the week.</description>

      <description>This week I have continued fixes in PnP handling of our USB stack. I was focused on usbhub and done number of fixes there. Let me describe process from begining.
Issue on MS&#39;s hidusb removal. As you may remember from previous post, now MS&#39;s usbccgp works under 2k3, sitting on the top of our ohci-hub pair. But that time I have also faced issue on it&#39;s removal. So to simplify debugging I have reproduced same issue with hidusb and saw the same behaviour under 2k3.</description>

      <description>I closed out last week by drawing a flow chart in preparation for restructuring my code for some new state variables. For most of this week, I was figuring out details about, and implementing, this chart.&amp;nbsp;
One of new state variable I added in is one variable in the CONNECTION_CONTEXT struct, specifying what that particular connection is doing. This way, my driver can easily identify a socket as bound or not, whether it is currently connected, and what operations it is trying to perform.</description>

      <description>From beginning of week I started reading more stuffs (core) about AHCI and trying to plan a road map which I will follow after making first version of AHCI driver. Throughout the week I made some progress with Interrupt Handler and AHCI port programming. Though I have finished port programming routine and next I will complete Interrupt Handler followed by Srb functions.
Port programming is still untested (fingers crossed), because I can&#39;t test it without Interrupt Handler routine (I can, but It will not give 100% surety) looking forward to get these two routines tested in this week.</description>

      <description>Progress At the beginning of the week I finished cleaning up and committing the code I wrote related to extending a file&#39;s size. This took me a little longer than I expected and in the future I&#39;m going to commit more often so I don&#39;t have this problem.
From there I added support for truncating files, with a couple of caveats. This is significant because it allows for opening a file in Notepad.</description>

      <description>After long period of investigation and debugging, this week I have commited first patches for review. And they make difference under 2k3 :)
About fixes I&#39;ve done
As continuation of usbhub&#39;s PnP handler debug and testing, this week I have commited patches with fixes. The most important ones are described below (same description is given in commit messages too).
&amp;nbsp;PDO: Changed handling of IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE On this IRP we should free recources and delete child&#39;s PDO ONLY if it isn&#39;t presented physically on the bus.</description>

      <description>Going into week 5, I started with a code-complete but very much incorrect implementation of the TDI_SEND and TDI_RECEIVE IRQ handlers. My TCP_CONTEXT data structure and the existing ADDRESS_FILE data structure both did not contain a way to keep track of pending IRQs, so I had no way of keeping track of outstanding pending IRQs and what connection contexts they were supposed to be associated with. Without a clear scheme for keeping track of the information, IRP pointers invariably got lost.</description>

      <description>Mid-term evaluations opened up yesterday, and naturally I&#39;ve been super-busy this week, making sure I&#39;ve earned my keep! ;)
Getting the New Size Recognized in Windows Recall that I ended last week being able to extend a file&#39;s size in ReactOS, but Windows wasn&#39;t showing the newly written data when opening the file in notepad. My mentor Pierre and forum member Pathoswithin both suggested, independently, that my problems with extending a file might be caused by only increasing the size of the $DATA attribute and not also modifying the appropriate $FILE_NAME attribute associated with the file.</description>

      <description>This week I worked on AHCI IO Request Processing and FIS programming part. I implemented IO Queue, Slot distribution mechanism for AHCI requests. Updated Github&#39;s PR for next round of code review.
Next I will be working on port programming i.e. telling the controller about the slots that I&#39;ve allotted for IO request.
Very soon we will have a running AHCI device driver :D
I also added a notes.txt file which actually tracks my progress for every routine/support link</description>

      <description>TO LEARN HOW TO SWIM, YOU NEED TO GET INTO THE WATER. At the start of the week I was debugging the system crash on ROS&#39;s usbhub unload in Win2k3. I spent a lot of time asking questions and discussing topics related to WDM with my mentor Thfabba. He kind of kickstarted me, giving small tasks and then analyzing with me the results. During that sessions I have gathered many new tips related debugging and also started feeling much more confidently working with WDM.</description>

      <description>This week, I started off chasing down how to handle TDI sending a new IRQ to create a connection context immediately after a connection has been accepted on the server end. At first, I thought it was for socket multiplexing. As I talked more with Art and looked more into the lwIP source code, I realized that this is an attempt by TDI to support backlogging. As such, this was not something I had to actively handle since lwIP has full backlogging support.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ll put my vision toward the version 1.0 of driver first. If we come to the uni_ata which is actually right now supporting React OS with SATA AHCI driver. uni_ata is actually operating SATA device in legacy mode of operation and with no support of NCQ. Although NCQ is not really necessary for now, because I think we are right now targeting to have hardware support as much as we can (this is as per my understanding).</description>

      <description>Learning About NTFSI spent most of the week studying NTFS in-depth, and really learning about some of the things I glossed over before. This is something I had to do make meaningful progress with increasing file sizes. This involved (re-re-re-)reading the three relevant chapters in File System Forensic Analysis.
Also, in order to retain and really understand the information, I&amp;#39;ve started making a standalone app that lists files on an NTFS partition.</description>

      <description>This week I haven&amp;rsquo;t spent much time on project, I was passing yearly final exams in my university. By the end of the week I have passed all my exams with excellence (which means that I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my scholarship) and with peace of mind started working on my GSoC project.As I mentioned in previous post I have found some Issues in ROS USB stack driver&amp;rsquo;s uninstall/unload flows, and started debugging. This time I decided to spend some time to understand deeper ROS&amp;rsquo;s USB stack (from code perspective) before any try of debugging, because I&amp;rsquo;ll spend much more trying to understand things on the fly.</description>

      <description>In week 3, I discovered a lot more about how data is being passed around.
After more in depth inspection of the memory, I realized that Winsock was passing on the correct IP address; I just wasn&#39;t aware of the data structure it was using. After modifying my driver to correctly extract the IP address from the IRP, my test server and client performed a successful TCP connection hand shake, with my client program exiting correctly.</description>

      <description>In the first week I gained enough knowledge to kick start the coding part. I started implementation with minimal featured design idea i.e. started implementation of non-optional routines first and in order they are being called by Storport/OS. Listed below   DriverEntry:  Registered the driver with very standard configurations (that I learned by WDK samples) and with non-optional (required entrypoint for Storport) Hw Routines. Standard configuration includes NeedPhysicalAddresses (TRUE)</description>

      <description>This week I spent a few days hammering out all the problems I was having with MSVC builds, understanding exactly what was causing them, and updating configure.cmd so nobody else would have them in the future. See my forum post for the details. I&#39;ve also been doing a lot of reading this week, both on the peculiarities of NTFS, and on Windows file system drivers. File System Forensic Analysis by Brain Carrier has been an incredible resource for the former, and Windows Nt File System Internals by Rajeev Nagar has been indispensable for the latter.</description>

      <description>The second week of coding period I spend on testing and debugging.
As you may remember from previous post, there were all fails in UHCI test spreadsheet. This week I&amp;#39;ve done same tests with all ROS&amp;#39;s usb stack injected along with &amp;quot;usbuhci.sys&amp;quot; but this also not helped. So we can assume that UHCI is not working under 2k3. Also I&amp;#39;ve found bug (crash) in UHCI driver uninstall flow. In case of EHCI, it is normally denying removal, but in case of UHCI I&amp;#39;m seeing system crash coming from &amp;quot;hub.</description>

I spent the first part of the week figuring out how to extract the information I need from the IRP my driver receives in order to pass it along to lwIP.</description>

      <description>To be honest I started working on project after my college finals i.e. 27th of May, Before that I tried to setup build environment and test bed in virtual machine running win2k3. I was totally new to NT driver development so I started my journey with reading storage stack model and NT driver development guide.
In the first week I explored storage stack of NT 5.2 completely and presented my work plan to my mentor.</description>

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Why ROS?Now, when human is becoming more and more dependent on computer it becoming critical to have open-source OS on it. You can feel really secured only when you&amp;lsquo;re able (allowed) to see any part of OS which can control all your data. For the student who is studying computer science, the best choice was Linux (especially when classroom computers working only under it).</description>

      <description>Hi there! My name is Trevor Thompson and I&#39;m working on NTFS write support for Google Summer of Code 2016. Status Update: I now know the basics of windbg. I&#39;m surprised at how powerful this tool is! A few weeks ago, Pierre asked if I could take a look at largemcb.c and help him fix the bugs that were causing kmtest to fail the FsRtlMcb test. I didn&#39;t have a chance to look at it until now, but I felt like this would be a perfect opportunity to get some practice with windbg and get started with serious React OS development.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS team is proud to announce the release of version 0.4.1 a mere three months after the release of 0.4.0. The team has long desired an increased release tempo and the hope is that this will be the first of many of faster iterations.
Due to the brief period of time between the two releases, 0.4.1 is ultimately a refinement of what was in 0.4.0. That is not to say that there are no new features of course, and a few highlights of both categories are listed below.</description>

After some days went past I will now sum up the main events of the CLT 2016 for you.
The event took place from 19th - 20th March at Technische Universität of Chemnitz. This year the team was smaller than the years before and only Thomas Faber and me (for ppl that don&#39;t know me: Daniel Reimer) have made it. The hotel we booked was the Hoteloper Chemnitz. Tryin to stay sort of cheap we had a two bed room in deluxe size (at least one of two guys in that team could kill with the noise he makes @ night ^^).</description>

A great deal of work has gone into making this release happen and as we look back it is remarkable to consider how far the project has come since that release a decade ago. This release is both a celebration of and a testament to everything that the ReactOS team and community has achieved together.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, the ReactOS website has been completely revamped. During the last year, the ReactOS Team has been focusing on entering the 0.4 era, the latest major alpha series before the 0.5 Beta. A common feeling among the ReactOS community was that our (now old) website was not good enough from content, design, and technology points of view to honor one of the greatest releases in the ReactOS history.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve invested a great deal of time and effort to making building ReactOS as painless as possible and the ReactOS Build Environment is the fruit of those labors. Instead of requiring you to go and hunt down a half dozen different packages, the RosBE bundles all of the tools needed to get started with ReactOS development.
 CMake - The build generation program used to describe the source code of ReactOS so that a variety of compiler toolchains can be used to build it.</description>

      <description>As ReactOS is still in alpha stage development, we encourage would-be testers to first try it out on a virtual machine before taking the plunge with real hardware. Of course regardless of whether you do a physical or virtual install there are some basic requirements to keep in mind.
 x86 processor, Pentium-class or newer 96MB of RAM, 256MB recommended 650MB of free space minimum, 5GB+ recommended if you intend to do testing VGA compatible graphics card, VESA BIOS 2.</description>

      <description>Getting Involved with ReactOS There are many different ways to get involved with ReactOS. Immense time and effort went into creating the NT family of operating systems, including Windows XP and 2003. As ReactOS aspires to be a replacement for Windows, the same amount of resources would ensure the rapid progress of the project. This is where you can play a part.

      <description>I was looking into CORE-9105, a crash in wget.exe, but I couldn&#39;t reproducde it, so I asked Daniel whether he was using an MSVC build or a GCC build. He used a GCC build and I was using an MSVC build. So I tried with a GCC build and the bug appeared. So I looked at this thing with kdbg. And there the first bug showed up.
Bug #1: KDBG and break points I set a breakpoint at a position that I wanted to step through and KDBG stopped there.</description>

When Z logged onto the ROS virtual net he was met with two unexpected things.&amp;nbsp; Seeing as one involved an AI hivemind that the team still did not fully understand he decided to satisfy his curiosity with the other surprise.
“Colin.”
The German man glanced up.&amp;nbsp; “Oh, hey Z.&amp;nbsp; Wasn’t expecting you in today.”
“Likewise,” Z said with a slight smirk.&amp;nbsp; “Don’t you Europeans check out for the entire week before Christmas?</description>

 Point 1: Status Reports Point 2: 0.4.0 Release plans  Point 1: Status Reports [TheFlash]: He started working on the NTVDM Sound Blaster emulation, however he realized that he&#39;s completely unable to test anything sound-related on ReactOS. KVM doesn&#39;t support the only card we have (CMI8378) and the rest would require non-free drivers, the use of which he finds contradictory to his ideals.</description>

      <description>Drivers come in many forms as does the hardware they control.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps one of the simplest types of drivers to write for the NT kernel is an NDIS driver for network cards, simplest being in the context of kernel development.&amp;nbsp; That simplicity comes from how the framework used for NIC drivers abstracts away some of the manual setup needed for drivers, eliminating a lot of boilerplate code and making it easier to get a handle on the actual hardware operations being performed.</description>

      <description>Free and Open Source. Free as &#34;you can download it for free&#34;, and open source..which means...you can see how ReactOS is coded, you can modify it, you can provide patches for any bugs you find, and even more: You can create your own ReactOS versions!
You&#39;re using Open Source software daily if you use Firefox, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, GNU-Linux distributions among zillions of Open Source projects out there. 
The Open Source projects, as ReactOS, are driven for and by its Community, so being active translating, donating, or coding is a way to help ReactOS boost forward.</description>

      <description>You can help translating in at least two different ways. The first one is helping to translate this website (for now it is just in English), the second one is helping to translate the operating system. Here you can find a guide about how to request a position to translate the site, and here an awesome tool created by XXXX which helps you to find which files are needed to be translated.</description>

      <description>Being part of a Worldwide Community, as ReactOS is, will boost your own personal skills to a highest new level. Working teamed with people from different countries will enhance your team-working, empathy and English. All these skills are really appreciated by companies out there in job interviews. Contributing your free time into an open source project seems to be also trending and marks a difference withing you and another candidate for the same job.</description>

      <description>A pity you&#39;re not a Developer. But ey! ReactOS needs more skills than just Devs. We&#39;re always seeking for real testers. Yeah, becoming a REAL tester is not easy, but it&#39;s funny. Also for designers to enhance our iconsets, create resources for the website or events where ReactOS is shown. Writers willing to create a small snip of text to share the latest ReactOS enhancements. Translators for our website and the operating system itself.</description>

      <description>Yes, we are. We are not using any Microsoft Windows source code. All our code has been created from scratch. That&#39;s the reason, btw, why we still have bugs...otherwise we&#39;d be perfect...or as perfect as Windows is.
This is one of the most asked questions, and it&#39;s funny...because we&#39;re daily using tons of different brands of cars, while the first inventor was Mercedes, and noone asks if using a Ford car is &#34;</description>

      <guid>https://costanzaltavilla.github.io/socan-i-install-reactos-and-run-any-software-compatible-windows-it/</guid>
      <description>Probably yes. However we highly recommend to check first if your favourite app runs in ReactOS. 
ReactOS is still an on-going project and not all the apps and drivers runs perfect on it. 
The best way to check the compatibility is to install ReactOS inside a virtual machine ( a step by step and video guide can be found here) and try your own needs. 
There are tons of pieces of software and, as you may imagine, is impossible to track all of them.</description>

      <guid>https://costanzaltavilla.github.io/which-are-differences-then-between-windows-r-and-reactos/</guid>
      <description>There are mainly two. First, ReactOS is open source. Second, ReactOS is Free. 
Also, Windows 8 and Windows 10 are known to monitor all your activity by default. So if you&#39;re concerned about your privacy or just don&#39;t want to share any personal info, we promise (and you can check our open source code) we don&#39;t track any of your data.</description>

      <description>Interested in ReactOS development? Becoming a ReactOS developer is both simple and rewarding. The codebase allows developers of all different backgrounds and skillsets to find something that interests them, and allows them to get going quickly using our excellent build environment.  The challenge of working on a mainstream operating system is something many people are interested in, however the opportunities to do so are rather limited. Linux and BSD are the obvious choices, but not everyone wants to work in a unix environment or are put off by the vast scale of unix communities and the large choice on offer.</description>

      <description>Day -1 (5th of August) As Aleksey arrived well before the hackfest started, Colin was kind enough to show the city in its full glory on a very hot day: the cathedral, springs, restaurants and cafes, and definitely the RWTH university buildings spread across the city. The most relevant was the temporary seminar building where a large room was dedicated for the Hackfest. It turned out to be a clean and modern equipped building which is indeed temporary and will be demolished once the real building is finished, so ReactOS is not the only one to utilize temporary hacks until full implementation is done :).</description>

      <description>As some of you may already know, my university gave me the unique opportunity to choose a ReactOS topic for my bachelor thesis. Three months ago, my decision fell on the Printing Stack, which was totally non-existing in ReactOS at that time. Since then, you can watch my daily progress in the colins-printing-for-freedom branch.
The Printing Stack as found in modern Windows&amp;reg; versions is a beast of its own. Microsoft&amp;reg; never wanted to sacrifice backwards compatibility with each new Windows version, so the widely used higher level GDI Printing APIs (like StartDoc or EndDoc found in gdi32.</description>

      <description>The Russian Federation along with the BRICS nations are pursuing measures to rid vendor lock-in of strategically important software (http://minsvyaz.ru/en/events/33237/) and substitute such software with free/open software (http://minsvyaz.ru/en/events/32967/). As such an initiative would provide considerable benefits beyond that of any singular agenda, Aleksey Bragin decided to take part in that on behalf of ReactOS Foundation. Since October 2014 he has been a member of the Operating Systems workgroup formed by the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications (so-called &#34;</description>

      <description>ReactOS is proud to announce the ReactOS Community&amp;nbsp;YouTube&amp;nbsp;Channel!
Its main goal is to share all of the videos of ReactOS in one main spot. This way, the entire ReactOS community, and the whole world, will be able to see the progress of ReactOS and what it can do. We hope for this channel to become a central place for all the community&#39;s contributions in terms of videos.
The ReactOS Community YouTube Channel can also be used as PR to the world.</description>

      <description>It sometimes happens that in your program you need to divide integer values and then round the result.
Something like
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; int result = lrint((double)int_a / (double)int_b);
But sometimes it is desirable to not use floating point math at all. The question is: Can we do the same calculation with integer math and get exactly the same result?
Let&amp;#39;s simplify our case, by limiting to unsigned values (for signed values it is very similar, only the formulas get a bit more complex).</description>

      <description>If you are a Windows user, you may be used to seeing a bunch of updates pop up around the second Tuesday of every month that purport to fix &#34;critical security issues.&#34; Microsoft&#39;s continuous effort to fix these vulnerabilities in its operating system consumes a lot of resources, but it is well worth it to the users: in a world of ever-increasing cyber security threats, no hole in our computers&#39; defenses should be left open to potential attackers.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
You will have noticed the long delay since my last report, and may be wondering what has happened. I will try to explain.
The last report was published on the 24th, right before christmas eve, when my vacation started. I took my vacation so that I could rest, clear my head, and regain energy so that I could resume my work in January at full speed. Over the christmas days, I had time for resting, games, hobbies, and family, and this gave me a lot of time to think.</description>

      <description>Dear all,

On the 20th of January, we discovered a vulnerability affecting our infrastructure. This vulnerability has been immediately fixed after its discovery. Unfortunately, it was a vulnerability present for years on the infrastructure.

This vulnerability was affecting our main users database. This means that our complete user database may have leaked, including user name, password (hashed) and email address.

We do not have any evidence that the database actually leaked.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
Because Christmas was so close to the weekend, I decided to delay the report a few days, and release it on time for the holidays, and this way include in the report everything that has happened over the weekend and the beginning of this week.
The past week began by reviewing some patches that were pending for a LONG time. Sadly, most of them were too bit-rotten to be applicable as-is, so I had to contact the patches’ authors and request an update.</description>

      <description>Before I begin, I should make clear that for all intents and purposes I am not a &#34;developer&#34; on the project. I have actually tried very hard to avoid falling into that role, as most people who do become developers end up getting sucked into that work to the point where of the time they do dedicate to the project, they tend to not have any left over to do other work that the project needs.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone!
I think the best way to explain how this week started is by recreating a conversation that happened on IRC (shortened and cleaned so that it looks more serious and professional then the typical IRC conversation):
gadamopoulos: Oh gigaherz, we have bugs due to the conversion to c++. Pretty obvious ones. CTaskBand is a mess: punkSite is ambigouous, as member and parameter.
gigaherz: I tried to find all of those, did I miss some?</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
If you remember from last week, my top priority was to investigate the crash when pasting files, but because Giannis insisted a bit that I should fix the merged folders usage so that the windows classes can be used instead of our own, I went back to the merged folders, and started looking at why the windows classes didn’t work. The first thing I had to fix was a misunderstanding of the return value of the filtering callback, which returns S_FALSE if the item is shown, and S_OK if the item has to be filtered away.</description>

      <description>Hello and sorry for yet another delay!
As you will most probably know (and if you don’t, you should take a look at the news on the front page!), the shell branch was merged last Wednesday evening, as a thanksgiving gift from the project to all the contributors. As things happen when a big merge is done and people with varied configurations start testing, it wasn’t 5 minutes that the first big “oh shit” bug report came in.</description>

      <description>To all the community members, we of the ReactOS Project present an early Thanksgiving present in the form of the merging of the explorer_new branch into trunk. It has been a long road with explorer_new&#39;s development having stretched many years. It is only fitting that we also celebrate the people who contributed so much to bringing this to fruition, some of whom we pay specific thanks to below.
The first such person actually never touched explorer_new, but his contribution should not be overlooked.</description>

      <description>Hello and sorry for the delay.
This past week has been rather strange. My goal was to add some quick tests to ensure that my implementation was matching Windows’ behaviour, and then send the changes to WINE. But as I was adding more details to test, I was finding more mismatches between Windows and ReactOS (well, WINE code). Annoyingly, most of the mismatches are in the code not related to my changes, and on top of that, a few of the returned values had unexpected content.</description>

      <description>People following the SVN logs may have noticed Jerome Gardou creating a network rework branch and ripping out massive chunks of the current code. To explain what prompted this requires a bit of history and background. Many years ago Cameron Gutman imported the lightweight IP (lwIP) library so that ReactOS could take advantage of its TCP implementation for the network stack. It was only used for TCP however, meaning ReactOS was still relying on its existing implementation for things like UDP and ICMP.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome back to my weekly report.
As I said in the last report, I ended the week trying to fix the start menu closing on a second click. The realization that Windows doesn’t close the shell menus on mouse up, allowed me to simplify some of the logic, but the issue still resisted my attempts.
After some very long hours trying to figure out where the code went wrong, I realized the order of the events was actually wrong.</description>

      <description>Hello again, people.
Wow so another week has passed, and the whole weekend too. I feel a bit like I was sucked into a temporal distortion, because I can’t really tell where all these hours have gone. Heck, I almost forgot to write the report! Thankfully, the cold I spoke about last week, it didn’t complicate itself, so I have been able to work over the week.
I suppose many of you didn’t wait for the surprise and looked at the commit logs, or read the comment thread for the “spoilers”.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to release version 0.3.17. A major new feature for this release is the inclusion of NTVDM, which provides support for a wide range of 16bit applications, a long requested feature by the community. NTVDM is still undergoing work but we felt that it was ready enough to provide a sneak peak to the wider community. In addition, the leadup to the 0.3.17 release saw a very impressive round of testing by the community.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, and sorry for the delay.
I caught a bad cold (that may or may not be complicated with a throat infection -- we&#39;ll see) so I was lacking the necessary concentration to write this report earlier.
As Z98 said last weekend, it has been some very busy days for all the team. I want to reiterate all the appreciation for the help given by everyone. There is just so much debugging I can do without my head exploding, and finding leaks tends to cross that line.</description>

      <description>David is currently a tad busy getting the shell branch ready for the big merge, so I am taking over his usual report this time. Last week was a flurry of activity as David, Giannis, and a community member who wishes to be identified as &#34;V&#34; (those of you in IRC will know who he is, but he requested that we refrain from posting his nick and I expect the rest of the community to honor his request) investigated the large number of memory leaks that explorer_new suffered from.</description>

      <description>This is somewhat belated, but for the past month Jérôme Gardou has been working under a development grant issued by ReactOS Deutschland e.V. Jerome has been active working on the memory manager and his fixes were instrumental to getting a modern Java runtime to work. Other efforts with the Common Cache will help pave the way for adding support for more advanced and modern filesystems to ReactOS. Jerome&#39;s contract saw him pay special attention to the three applications, Chrome, Java, and Microsoft Office, voted on for support in the Community Edition, and several fixes were made to the network stack as he sought to stabilize Chrome.</description>

      <description>About a year ago I basically disappeared from the project, showing up only very intermittently to write up snippets of text as requested by the team. The reason was I was ramping up for my master&#39;s project, an attempt to put a GPU design on an FPGA. For those of you who do not know what FPGAs are, think of them as chips that you can modify the digital logic on to change its functionality.</description>

      <description>Hello again!
As I mentioned in the last report, I had been writing tests to find the problems in SHFileOperation. All I knew was that in some situations it would end without fully writing some file, so I wrote tests moving, copying and deleting a folder structure, and comparing the copy with the original. I tried with empty files first, then with files of random sizes, then with really big files, and also with a lot of files of relatively small size.</description>

      <description>Hello!
It’s this time of the week again where I have to sit down and try to remember everything I have been doing over the week.
I began the week by looking at some older pending bugs. First, I looked at an issue where using the branch with the vmware audio driver installed would crash stobject.dll and because it’s loaded into explorer-new, the rest of the desktop and taskbar. I couldn’t reproduce this issue, so I moved on.</description>

      <description>Hello again!
This week has been strange. It has mostly been a series of disappointments, but it ended in some really good news.
I started this week by implementing the parser for the shell DDE commands. The syntax is simple, so the parser itself didn’t take long to finish. I tested it and debugged it in Windows at first, and when I was satisfied that the code was working the way I wanted it, I moved the functions into their rightful place inside shell32, and proceeded to test the function in ReactOS.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Foundation officially joins the Open Invention Network! The Open Invention Network is a shared defensive patent pool with the mission to protect Linux. Launched in 2005, OIN has strong industry support with backing from Google, IBM, NEC, Philips, Red Hat, Sony and SUSE (a business unit of Novell). ReactOS is just a small piece in this big opensource world and even if we&#39;re not a Linux project, helping to protect the opensource spirit is, and will always be, a must for us.</description>

      <description>Hello again!
You may remember from last week I said I would need more information in order to implement the mechanism browseui uses to open new windows in an existing process.
Well, spoiler alert if you haven’t read the SVN log: I got the information, and I wrote an implementation.
First of all, it turns out message 1037 is related to the rooted idlists. Since rooting is completely unimplemented at all the levels down to the implementation of the idlists, I stopped trying to figure out that message, and instead focused on the important one, 1035.</description>

      <description>The answer to the mystery about the bunnies’ extracurricular activities came soon enough, in no small part thanks to the amount of time the two spent investigating.&amp;nbsp; The bunnies were extremely useful helper utilities and if they were suffering from a bug, it needed fixing otherwise the project would risk losing one of its more useful tools.&amp;nbsp; By the end of these events the bunnies would be considered one of the core assets underpinning the entire project.</description>

      <description>Hello!
Another weekend, another report.
The week was slightly shorter for me due to having the project defense on Tuesday, so I spent most of Monday preparing for the presentation, and most of Tuesday afternoon recovering from it. If you are curious, I got a 9.5/10 on the project. ;P
In the context of the shell, this week I mostly continued my investigations on the IPC mechanism used by browseui to open new windows in the existing process.</description>

      <description>Hello again!
When I said last week’s report would be short, I was still planning to write a few lines about what I had been doing on the spare time from the university project, but by the time the weekend came I was way too mentally exhausted to actually do it. Then I started refreshing my mind with what I was in the middle of doing, and by Sunday night I had the explorer command line parser working more or less as intended (it still has a few places where it doesn’t behave exactly like Windows’ parser, but it’s close enough for what we need).</description>

      <description>The legacy memory manager in ReactOS has many idiosyncrasies and architectural quirks, issues that have dogged the project for many years now. The ARM team began a rewrite, colorfully named Another Rewrite of the Memory Management Module (ARM3), that partially supplanted the old memory manager but a big chunk of responsibility still lie with it, namely in the form of MEMORY_AREA. Simply put, MEMORY_AREA was the means by which memory address ranges were tracked, tracking which is necessary for things like handling paging.</description>

      <description>The incident that ultimately aroused the suspicion of the project technically occurred first but the analysis was concluded afterwards so it was generally treated as the second checkpoint in the road to the revelation.&amp;nbsp; The initial reaction hovered between heavy uncertainty and cautious concern, a concern that only grew over time.
 The briefing with the various governmental representatives came and went and was as excruciatingly pointless and braindead as Z had presumed.</description>

      <description>Hello, Everyone!
I mentioned last week, that I had started looking at the DDE server support, and it would take a while.
What I forgot to mention, is that the deadline for handing over my final project at university is next Friday, and the defense for the project a couple weeks after that. Ideally, if me &amp;amp; the other guys working on the project had done everything on schedule, we’d just be finishing off the documentation and we’d be almost ready, but as projects go, it’s always when the deadline looms close that you remember everything you were supposed to have been doing.</description>

      <description>An extremely rare data corruption issue caused by the Portable Structured Exception Handling library was discovered recently, one that is rather interesting in all the factors to come into play to bring it about. PSEH was a library created by KJK::Hyperion and massively overhauled by Timo Kreuzer for its third iteration, intended to bring Structured Exception Handling to GCC. SEH is natively supported by Microsoft&#39;s compilers and underpins a lot of error handling on Windows and so was necessary for proper compatibility between ReactOS&#39; components and Windows&#39;.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
I know I promised weekly reports but it’s summer time and, although I haven’t really been out on vacation, I have been taking my schedule a lot more loosely than usual.
After fixing the stobject compilation, I set my sights on the file browser menus. I began by trying to figure out how the Windows shell manages the menus, and I realized that most of the actual work was done in the WM_INITMENUPOPUP message handler.</description>

Aleksey Bragin noted that he still had some patches for ARWINSS that needed to be merged in. David Quintana reported that had implemented support for shell service objects and added a skeleton component that contains the system tray for things like volume control, battery icon, USB disconnection, and the like.</description>

      <description>These days when asked what a moonshot was, most people would respond with blank looks and then ask if it had something to do with the moon.&amp;nbsp; A few more knowledgeable persons might respond that it referred to the Apollo program.&amp;nbsp; Still others would say it referred to any project whose chances of success were low or might take a very long time to show demonstrable success.&amp;nbsp; The Reactive Operator System fell squarely in that third category and it was with some irony that with every success it achieved its future goals became ever loftier.</description>

UltraVNC is a powerful, easy to use and free remote pc access software that can display the screen of another computer (via internet or network) on your own screen. The program allows you to use your mouse and keyboard to control the other PC remotely. It means that you can work on a remote computer, as if you were sitting in front of it, right from your current location.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! Long time no see!
As some of you will probably know by now, I had a cooking accident, wherein my hand was splashed by very hot olive oil. I will skip the shameful details, but I want to say that for the next 10 days, I was unable to code properly.
After those first 10 days, my bandage was replaced by a lighter dressing, which allowed me more mobility in my hand, and I began looking at my TODO list, for something “lighter” to pass the time.</description>

      <description>Hello, and welcome to my weekly report. I apologize for not having a report last weekend, so this week’s report will be longer than usual.
Reading the issues in the community-powered Shell TODO List got me thinking about some issues that I previously thought were too complex for phase 1. Biggest of all, was the implementation of the CMergedFolder class structure. This set of classes is almost completely undocumented, and I suspect it has multiple features that don’t really fit together.</description>

I want to finally start writing the reports on Fridays, so it hasn’t been that many days since the last report, and there was a holiday in the middle of this week and some craziness you may already be aware of, so this report may end up either shorter than usual, or at least different.

      <description>Most of the developers already know this, but my current job is as an engineer working on firmware and software for the trigger system of the Large Hadron Collider (yes, the thing that discovered the Higgs boson). Triggers are basically filters that take in the raw data coming out of the LHC and whittle down the noise to figure out what data is worth keeping and what can be discarded. This is something of a necessity as one of the physics professors that I spoke to mentioned the LHC generates something like a terabyte of data a second when doing collisions.</description>

      <description>After the frustration of last week, I decided to take one last look at Deleaker, and try to figure out why it crashes in ReactOS during COM registration.
The problem is, looking at the disassembly made it clear that the code is obfuscated. The functions start in one address, and then they jump all over the place, creating a mesh of small function chunks that even the best disassemblers seem unable to follow.</description>

I had to install Visual Studio 2010 and RosBE, and then download and compile the source code to verify that everything was working correctly. When I tried to compile, I realized two things. First, that vs2010 is much buggier than I remembered, and second, that compiling in a Virtual Machine with one cpu core is very very slow.</description>

      <description>After I finally managed to write last week’s report (have you ever tried to write something, and the words wouldn’t come out at all?), I continued looking at those nasty menu leaks.
In an attempt to make the task simpler, I started looking for software with the ability to detect USER handle leaks. I checked the free (libre) alternatives first, but after not much luck I moved on to free (beer) software, and to fully commercial and proprietary software, when I finally found Deleaker.</description>

I had been told that there was a JIRA issue related to the shutdown dialog, and that it had been implemented in some way in trunk already. I considered the means of calling that dialog from the shell32 function the start menu calls, but I dropped the idea some hours later, when I decided the code in msgina wasn’t designed to be called externally.</description>

      <description>The calculator in modern versions of Windows is a very useful tool, but it is still limited in many respects especially when trying to punch in a long computation. Third parties have come up with a variety of alternatives though and it is the Project&#39;s great pleasure to present Precise Calculator as another member of the Open Source Support Program.
Precise Calculator not only has feature parity with the native calculator on Windows, it offers a variety of enhancements such as unit conversions and even the ability to script calculations.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce PWCT as a new participant in the Open Source Support Program.
Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT) is a set of tools that tries to make GUI programming more accessible, especially for people with little programming experience.
PWCT is focused on visual programming&amp;nbsp; and comes with a very practical syntax editor. Its program paradigm ranges from imperative to event driven and uses tree hierarchies instead of a drag-and-drop style.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased another participant in the Open Source Support Program, PeaZIP.
Many community members have been asking that some sort of zip utility be bundled with ReactOS for convenience and while participation in the program does not mean PeaZIP will be present by default, it will make it considerably easier for users to pre-stage PeaZIP so that it will be available to use once the installation of ReactOS is complete.</description>

      <description>If you recall from the last report, I had a few issues that I couldn’t fix myself. Well, Huw (Frontier) surprised me by sending me a patch to fix the activation issue!
One of the issues in explorer-new was that every time you clicked on the desktop to open a new folder, it would launch a new instance of explorer.exe and run the new window on it. While the underlying issue still remains (it requires implementing the DDE handler for explorer), by disabling the version of the desktop window from RShell and using the existing one from shell32 instead, the shell takes a shortcut and runs the window directly on its own instance.</description>

      <description>Computer Aided Design software has long been the bastion of proprietary vendors such as Autodesk and SolidWorks where license seats tend to run into the thousands of dollars, putting them well out of reach of enthusiasts and hobbyists. It has only been recently that software for design work has become more accessible and in many ways this accessibility has helped spawn the entire Maker revolution that is happening now.
The ReactOS Project is therefore very pleased to see LibreCAD join as the first member of the Open Source Support Program.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS installer is probably one of the oldest extant chunks of code in ReactOS that has not undergone significant overhauls for a very long time. Besides some tuning by Alex Ionescu to reduce resource usage and adding initial support for removable devices by Cameron Gutman, it has not seen any real major changes since Eric Kohl put it together all those years ago. For the developers, this was not too much of an issue since the installer did its job perfectly fine for the most part.</description>

      <description>Hello! Another weekend is here, time for me to write a new report…
Good news! I’m recovered and back on track! ;P
The week started by doing some boring investigation on how Windows manages the addressbar. If you didn’t guess already, analysing the behaviour of COM(ATL) classes is anything but simple. Interface inheritance is good for encapsulation, but bad for about anything else, including debugging. I did manage to figure out that it has two functions related to filling the addressbar combobox: one of them resets the contents and fills them from scratch, and the other only adds/changes/removes items related to the navigation.</description>

      <description>Open source is more than just individual bits of software in isolation, it is about the ecosystem and environment that those bits of software come together to create. To that end, as part of the Community Edition initiative the ReactOS Project has put together the Open Source Support Program to help its end users in building that environment. When a user installs a new operating system, one of the first things they need to do is go and install all of the applications that they actually need.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
This update will be rather short.
At the same time I was writing last week&#39;s post, I had already started to feel sore in my throat.
By Sunday evening, I had a slight fever, and by Monday it was obvious that I must have caught a flu.
I have been trying to poke around as I was recovering, but I couldn&#39;t really focus enough to do anything complex.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the delay! Drupal was causing issues on submitting new things.
This week I continued what I was doing the previous one.
I focused my efforts in the browse window, tweaking the existing code, fixing logic issues and cleaning up the code a bit.
There were some visual differences that were easy to fix, and others that will require a lot of work.
I added some code to extract the icon and show it in the titlebar.</description>

      <description>Another week is over, and it’s time for me to look back and convert all my efforts into words.
If you recall from the previous report, I was trying to fix the keyboard navigation. I managed to find and fix the issue that caused my code not to process the key presses correctly. With that issue fixed, I could implement the code to switch left and right between popup menus, and shell menus, both between a popup and a shell menu (which was already working last week), and between a shell menu and a popup.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the delay.
This past week has been full of holidays and the inevitable family meetings, so the report will be short.
After spending some more time on the context menu bug, I decided to leave it aside, and focus on things that improve the progress. If the code is incompatible with TortoiseGit for some reason, I can figure that out later.
The next issue on the list was the keyboard navigation.</description>

      <description>This week really didn’t “start”; it was merely a continuation of the past weeks.
The issue where the toolbar did not receive clicks was one of those annoying problems where finding the apparent cause is easy, but finding a solution not so much. The issue, as far as I could tell, was related to using SetCapture as a means to track the mouse movement on top of the toolbar. If I disabled that piece of code, the clicks got through, but – of course – other features stopped working.</description>

      <description>Dear all,

In case you don&#39;t use SSL/TLS on our infrastructure (web sites - drupal, jira, fisheye), skip reading (and reconsider your choices about such non-usage).

As you may (should?) have heard recently, OpenSSL has suffered a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160), known as Heartbleed Bug (http://heartbleed.com/). Most of our services were using an affected release of OpenSSL, with heartbeat feature activated. Be it, mails services, web services (Drupal, Jira).</description>

      <description>Over this past week, I continued fixing many small bugs, logic errors and such. Eventually I got to a point where I couldn’t deny the truth anymore.
One of the lessons you are taught when learning to be an engineer (including software programming), and one that some people find hard to accept, is that you should always try to reuse existing processes and components, instead of reinventing your own. Because of that, I tried very hard to let the toolbars manage their own hot-tracking and only intercept hot-tracking events when strictly necessary.</description>

      <description>If you have been following the weekly reports, you know that I have been having issues with the focus manager.
Well, this week I redesigned part of the focus manager, improving the structure so that it has more accurate information of what’s happening with the menus. While improving the code, I also fixed some bugs in the code.
By Wednesday, I had what appeared to be working code. While running it in Windows 7, everything seemed to work, both in the start menu and the menu bar.</description>

      <description>When work progresses, there’s a natural tendency towards running out of simple bugs to fix, and being left with those persistent ones that seem to have an intelligence of their own.
I thought I was over those. That the bug I was working on would be a simple one.
I wanted to have some test builds ready to share with the world, to be able to tell you all “hey look, if you don’t try to navigate with the keyboard, everything mostly acts the way it should, come and try!</description>

Big changes are coming, while you will find some of them desired and expected thanks to your feedback and support, you&#39;ll also be greatly surprised by some others: It&#39;s time to move ReactOS to the Next Level.</description>

      <description>I began the week by fixing the menus, so that they would properly display submenus, and react to clicks. I was stuck for a bit, but I finally managed to find the problem that prevented the menus from working correctly within ReactOS.
I set the filebrowser aside for a bit after this small success, to revisit some of the old bugs and pending tasks.
I took a fresher look at the exec issue, where items weren’t clickable unless a submenu had been opened first, and I (painfully) traced the issue to pointless/bogus WM_ACTIVATE messages, with the new HWND being equal to the old HWND.</description>

This was one of the more often requested features by the community, which was met with some ambivalence by the developers themsleves since it entailed a significant amount of work. Aleksander then appeared and instead of simply asking for the feature, rolled up his sleeve to do the actual work. Since then NTVDM has made significant progress and other developers like Hermès Bélusca-Maïto and community member Vampyre have joined in to help.</description>

You may remember this screenshot from last weekend’s report. In it, you can see the results of implementing vertical menus in a different, more documented, way. This method requires more work to be done per item, to make them all wrap into a new row, but it is supported by the Wine toolbar implementation ReactOS uses.</description>

      <description>This week’s work began by improving the look&amp;amp;feel of the start menu so that it matches the Windows start menu better.
The first step was to improve the look of the menu: This included positioning, colours, dropdown arrows, icon sizes, etc.
I continued by trying to improve the feel of the menu: Hot-tracking behaviours, keyboard navigation, etc. The keyboard navigation keeps resisting me somewhat, though, as it tends to glitch when using the left/right arrow keys to open and close submenus, but moving up and down seems to behave as expected.</description>

      <description>The week began by implementing the functionality needed to handle clicking on menu items. This involved sending a callback notification for the currently selected item, asking the callback to execute the appropriate action of the item.
Some of the items are not meant to be clicked on and are supposed to show a submenu instead. For these items I had to subclass the toolbar windows so that I could add a timer on hover and handle the opening of the submenu in the resulting WM_TIMER event, which would be received by the toolbar, but needed to be handled by my code.</description>

      <description>Work, this week, began with finishing the initial implementation of CMenuSite. This class and the window it creates act as an intermediary between a BaseBar and a MenuBand, forwarding the events and messages either to the child band, or to the parent bar, as necessary. It handles the sizing of the child band, to adapt it to changes in the available space. It also provides certain services related to the positioning and sizing of the child bar, which it handles by forwarding some requests to the child, and the rest to the parent.</description>

      <description>A lot of people have expressed excitement or enthusiasm regarding ARM though when asked to explain their enthusiasm the result has often been incoherent babbling. In other words, the vast majority of people still have trouble communicating their thoughts in a clear and, more importantly, concise, manner. ARM is interesting though and from multiple perspectives. The biggest point is the amount of processing power it represents despite its small physical, power, and thermal footprint.</description>

      <description>An interesting tidbit.
First because the motto seems to be real: &#34;We are All. We are everywhere&#34;.&amp;nbsp; Second, because they have just twitted the following::
&amp;nbsp;
As you may know, ReactOS began a Kickstarter campaign to create a business product to help supporting and boosting current ReactOS development.
What is it about?

Thorium Core is about taking the ReactOS operating system from the proof-of-concept and engineering stages to building a fast and lightweight solution that can be tailored to suit the computing needs of both private and commercial users.</description>

      <description>One of the main issues people trying out ReactOS have complained about is the clunkiness of the shell and how things they expect to work don&#39;t. As the shell serves as the main gateway to using the operating system, if it is hard to use then the OS itself becomes hard to use.
When talking about &#34;interaction&#34; we can think in two different ways of interaction: The interaction between the user and ReactOS Explorer and the interaction between applications and ReactOS Explorer(well, really the Shell).</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce the release of version 0.3.16. A little under a year has passed since the previous release and a significant amount of progress has been made. Some of the most significant include completion of the CSRSS rewrite and the first stages of a shell32 rewrite. 0.3.16 is in many ways a prelude to several new features that will provide a noticeable enhancement to user visible functionality.</description>

      <description>So there is this tendency amongst the community to ask why the project doesn&#39;t do this or the project doesn&#39;t do that. A lot of the stuff people want done would tend to fall into my area of responsibility. I tend to frown upon people who make more work for me so I often push back, hard, requiring that others demonstrate their willingness to do some heavy lifting before I will consider a proposal.</description>

      <description>Several months ago the ReactOS Foundation issued a development contract to Giannis Adamopoulos to work on improving ReactOS&#39; shell support. The end goal of this work was to get explorer_new running, though it was understood from the onset that a single contract may not be sufficient to finish the project. Still, the first contract would at least provide a solid foundation that could be built upon. The fruits of Giannis&#39; work were recently previewed with screenshots of explorer_new running on Windows 8 and its inclusion into ReactOS, even though not all functionality is working.</description>

      <description>A part of me feels a tad guilty testing all of you with promises regarding shell progress. Another part of me feels no guilt whatsoever and I tend to listen to that part more. It helps having no conscience when doing PR, I have found.
Anyway, recently I started doing the prep work needed for a new release of ReactOS, which will be 0.3.16 despite the constant badgering for me to just go ahead and call the next release 0.</description>

      <description>When people think about &#34;embedded&#34; systems, they often think about ARM systems running Linux. Well, that&#39;s one part of the embedded world, but another big chunk is actually x86 systems running Windows. For that matter, one of the biggest reasons for someone to use x86 in an embedded application is to get the ability to run Windows applications. There are a LOT of point-of-sale and other dumb terminals out there that run Windows due to the widespread availability of a Windows application to do damn near anything.</description>

      <description>Quite a few people that first look at Thorium ask questions about what exactly it is for and what purpose does it serve. These are not unreasonable questions to ask and the answers are sometimes difficult to parse due to the complexity of Thorium itself. The second set of questions relates to why we believe Thorium is achievable with the amount of funding requested. Let&#39;s go over both sets and hopefully they will convince you we aren&#39;t completely out of our minds.</description>

      <description>Right before Christmas, Aleksey Bragin and Steven Edwards launched the Thorium Core Kickstarter appeal. At its most basic level, the goal is to advance ReactOS development by creating a commercial project using it. The proposed product, as it were, is a remotely accessible desktop environment, basically a computer in the cloud. No longer does one need to shuffle around USB sticks or reinstall applications from computer to computer, simply connect to Thorium and you&#39;ll be back to your familiar setup.</description>

That being said, I&#39;ve decided for the short term to split things that would normally act as a single newsletter section into separate blog posts so I don&#39;t need to wait and gather things.
There was a lot of speculation as to what Monstera was when Aleksey made his commit with some suggesting it is a repeat of his ARWINSS effort but targetted at the memory manager.</description>

      <description>A year ago the project ran a donation drive to raise money to pay for funded development of ReactOS. While the drive was moderately successful, a slight paperwork issue with the German foundation caused a temporary halt to funded development contracts. Since then, the issue has been resolved and the project has been working to restart handing out development contracts to demonstrate that the money donated to the project is being put to good use.</description>

To achieve this goal, the GPL seeks to ensure that the source code is always available and that reusing the source code in question comes without any restrictions save for what the GPL itself imposes in order to ensure this &#34;</description>

      <description>VersioningThe question of changing the versioning scheme was brought up again by and Victor Martinez and Ziliang Guo. Objections came in principally two forms from developers, the first that none of them saw a reason for changing and the other that attempting to use a new scheme based on progress of components was futile as developers work on components at their whim and thus progress cannot be scheduled. Aleksey Bragin again attempted to push developers to make further use of JIRA to track development and thus perhaps set the stage for resolving the question of development progress.</description>

      <description>ShellSince the last newsletter Giannis Adamopoulos has completed his development contract and while a more formal report will be published later, a brief summary follows. The fruits of his labor are already visible in that explorer_new can actually start in ReactOS and allow a user to browse the directories. Much of this was achieved by completing work Andrew Hill started. Giannis also spent considerable amounts of time trying to understand how the various menus in the shell worked.</description>

      <description>Explorer Shell A while back the project announced a development contract for Giannis Adamopoulos to work on getting the necessary supports for running explorer-new to run on ReactOS. Since then, Giannis has been very busy and has made considerable progress. Much of his work has been properly separating responsibilities in the various components so that there are clear delineations of who does what.
There are two major accomplishments, both fairly wide in scope.</description>

      <description>C++ One of the last big missing pieces of building ReactOS using Visual Studio was support for C++. In ReactOS, the biggest piece of C++ code is explorer, without which users have no graphical shell when ReactOS boots up. Support for C++ requires not just a compiler capable of building C++ code, but also the presence of the standard template library. For developers where C++ was their first language, usage of the STL is fairly common and it is almost guaranteed to be linked in by default regardless of whether it is used or not.</description>

      <description>It is somewhat difficult to put into words just how much hate I have for this particular issue. Debugging it ended up taking an entire week and the result surprised pretty much everyone on the team, including the senior developers. The issue that was highlighted however has very deep root causes that touch upon the very foundation of the C ABI and its brittleness.
First, a slight aside. In C, there is a family of functions that take in a variable number of arguments, the printf functions.</description>

ProceedingsMeeting started at 19:11 by Aleksey Bragin.
Point 1: ContractsPoint 2: ReleasePoint 1Colin Finck reported that Matthias Kupfer had another meeting with tax advisers to try to resolve the issue of direct funding. Ziliang Guo prodded Aleksey Bragin again to remind him that the Russian ReactOS Foundation needed to start issuing invoices to cover existing contracts. A suggestion was made to hire freelancers to help develop the project, but there was internal resistance to this as traditionally open source projects do not fund development commercially like that unless under extraordinary circumstances.</description>

      <description>Weclome to the second part of the series where I discuss bugs that were truly irritating to debug. In general, fixing a bug is usually simple. Finding the bug is where the actual work is involved.
As I mentioned before, I currently work as an intern at a company that does development work on a UEFI BIOS. BIOS development is difficult because we are often so close to the hardware that we often do not have the convenience of things like a debugger.</description>

      <description>In the recent craze over smartphones, tablets, and what I&amp;#39;ll term webbooks (think ChromeOS machines), many companies seem to have forgotten the greatest achievement of modern desktop operating systems, namely the ability to multitask. Smartphone OSes originally either did not have this capability built in or did not expose it to the end user. This was understandable, as smartphones operate under different constraints with respect to power and screen space. Even tablets, with their higher power envelopes and bigger screens, are ultimately presented as consumption devices.</description>

      <title>ReactOS 0.3.15 Released</title>
      <link>https://costanzaltavilla.github.io/project-news/reactos-0315-released/</link>

      <guid>https://costanzaltavilla.github.io/project-news/reactos-0315-released/</guid>
      <description>The ReactOS project is proud to announce the release of version 0.3.15. A culmination of over a year of development, 0.3.15 incorporates several architectural enhancements to create a more compatible and conformant implementation of the NT architecture. Perhaps the most user visible enhancement is initial support for USB devices, both storage and input.
Infrastructure wise, this is the first release of ReactOS using CMake instead of rbuild. The conversion to CMake has allowed developers to generate Visual Studio solutions for working on the code, though several C++ components still need work before support for Microsoft&amp;#39;s toolchain is complete.</description>

      <title>Use cases for ReactOS</title>

      <guid>https://costanzaltavilla.github.io/blogs/use-cases-for-reactos/</guid>
      <description>Many people see ReactOS as a Windows XP successor, a way for them to avoid the changes Microsoft brought about in Windows 8. This is a somewhat idealized goal, as ReactOS would need to be much more complete before it could attempt to fill in that role. There are however other use cases for which ReactOS is much closer to being ready for. Many of these however are more business use cases than consumer use cases.</description>

      <description>Deciding whether to write this latest entry was a tad difficult, if only because I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like I&amp;#39;ve been harping a bit too much on Microsoft, but some of the information that has trickled out about the new Xbox bears some putting into context. Specifically, the requirement that anyone wanting to publish a game to Xbox Live needs to sign on with a publisher, so no self-publishing by indies.</description>

      <description>The project often gets suggestions for what people consider to be &amp;quot;improvements&amp;quot; over how Windows does something. Nothing wrong with that, save for the fact people rarely consider the implications of what they are asking for. The most recent spurt was in &amp;quot;enhancements&amp;quot; for the shell, some of it due to the renewed attention I started drawing to it. We&amp;#39;ll take the request for &amp;quot;full screen&amp;quot; application support to start with.</description>

The contract will involve extending the shell32 library to support running the explorer-new shell. Focus will be on the browseui components, needed to allow explorer-new to display its file browser. This is the first step to ultimately replacing the existing explorer shell. Duration: 2 months Time: 100 hours Rate: 600&amp;euro;</description>

      <description>Testing and Debugging The hardest thing about writing software is finding the source of bugs. Good testers are as such extremely valuable, and those able to use debuggers well even more so. Two issues were recently dealt with thanks to one such tester, Olaf Siejka.
The first issue involved Microsoft Excel Viewer, an application that as its name suggests allows for viewing of spreadsheets but not editing. Word Viewer actually worked in ReactOS, and Excel Viewer&amp;#39;s failure drew Olaf&amp;#39;s attention.</description>

      <description>After a considerable amount of effort, the issue with funding development using donations collected by ReactOS Deutschland e.V. has been worked around. As a result of this, the Project is working to arrange additional funded development to ensure that the money donated to the project is put to the use it was intended. We hope to pay special attention to the shell, themes, and USB to improve the overall user experience.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I talked a bit about how Microsoft&amp;#39;s fixation on Metro/Modern and the appstore had resulted in it basically ignoring large swathes of its developer community. So that post got a lot more attention than I was expecting, with some agreeing and others disagreeing. Some discussions however took a turn where people began debating how much trouble, if any, developers were in with Microsoft&amp;#39;s move. This was something that I had decided not to explore further because the previous post had already reached a fairly ridiculous length.</description>

      <description>Most people understand that Windows is used by a variety of people who have a variety of needs, ranging from corporate server to workstation to POS terminals to home PC and beyond. Most people accept that whenever Microsoft updates Windows, it has to balance the competing requirements to find some kind of workable compromise. There is however another set of competing requirements that many do not really register, even those that call themselves power users or are IT admins.</description>

      <description>In my years working as a programmer, I have run into many, many bugs and introduced many of my own. A few stand out as tremendously irritating to debug, as their behavior made little sense and the source of the bug was non-obvious. The first issue was from my work for the HTCondor Project, an open source cluster management software used by research groups around the world including those working on crunching data from the Large Hadron Collider, the LIGO graviton detector, and the IceCube neutrino observatory.</description>

      <description>Despite my involvement with the project for several years, I do not believe I have ever actually introduced myself. While the developers and a few other members of the community know about me, in general the rest of the community knows me as the guy that writes the newsletters and sometimes posts snarky comments on the forum whenever I see something that I think is a bad idea. As such, this might be a good time to introduce myself and provide some background.</description>

      <description>OpenGL The ReactOS project has relied on the Mesa Project for OpenGL 3D graphics for a long time, but unfortunately the code needed by ReactOS is no longer maintained by Mesa. Actual rendering involves a chain of components, one of which is the called the installable client driver. The ICD is for the most part bundled with the graphics card driver, though it can also be a driver that performs rendering completely in software.</description>

Assuming one has translation privileges, at the top of the page below the page title is a series of tabs. Do NOT click on the Edit tab EVER. Click on the Translate tab to be taken to the translation page. If there is not a Translate tab, you either do not have translation privileges or the page was marked as non-translatable by the administrators.</description>

      <description>Site Migration The project recently migrated from its old site to one using the Drupal content management system. Work on this migration had been going on in some form for the last year, with a major milestone being the migration from Bugzilla to JIRA. The migration of the site proper however was nowhere as smooth as many people, including myself, desired. One of the root causes for the bumpy migration was my fault actually, when I sent an email claiming that the site&#39;s content was at a state where it should not be a blocker to migration.</description>

      <description>The following is a quickstart guide to help newcomers with getting a ReactOS development environment set up. As contributors become more comfortable, each is likely to find his or her own preferred workflow and tool set, but this guide will at least provide a gentle introduction to retrieving, building, and running ReactOS code. This guide assumes a sufficiently modern computer able to compile ReactOS and then run it inside a virtual machine.</description>

      <description>Installing ReactOS is very much like installing Windows XP. However, due to it still undergoing heavy development, a few pointers are helpful when first getting started. Installation Platform ReactOS currently supports running on x86 processors with x64 support still in development. In additional to real hardware, ReactOS also supports running on a variety of virtual machine platforms. More details on setting up ReactOS can be found on the virtual machines page.</description>

      <description>ReactOS uses resource files to hold translations. These must be encoded using UTF-8 so take care the text editor used on these files does not accidentally change the encoding. Each language&#39;s resource file must be included in the rsrc.rc or application.rc file of the respective component being translated. Please keep in mind that some components are imported from WINE and as such translations of those components should be sent upstream instead.</description>

      <description>Virtual machines provide a stable and known configuration for ReactOS to run on, reducing the chances that misbehaving hardware could destabilize the operating system. They are especially helpful when developing and testing higher level components of ReactOS. Several virtual machine platforms are supported and a basic guide to getting ReactOS running on them and configuring for debug support. Suggested resource allocation for all of the following virtual machine platforms is a minimum of 128MB of RAM and 2GB of storage space.</description>

      <description>Debugging ReactOS over serial tends to be the most reliable methodology as it minimizes the risk of losing debug output when ReactOS crashes compared to directing output to a file or application in ReactOS. It however takes a bit more setup on the receiving side and some extra hardware if attempting to debug a physical machine. The following provides basic instructions for setting up serial on both the sending and receiving side.</description>

      <description>Desktops and Windows In the Windows operating system, the desktop one sees is made up of three things, a kernel mode desktop object, a user mode desktop window, and a desktop thread. While the desktop object can be considered almost mundane, the window and thread are somewhat special. In Windows, desktop windows are created differently from regular windows and all share a single desktop thread. This thread handles messages sent to the desktop window, though users will generally only see the desktop window if the explorer shell is not running.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is delighted to announce another development contract funded by community donations. Mike Nordell was a previous ReactOS developer that went on sabbatical but continued to drop in to check on the project from time to time. As such, he has considerable experience developing ReactOS and extensive knowledge about the Windows NT architecture. As many people are aware of, ReactOS has a large test suite that checks to see whether specific functionality is working or not.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is pleased to announce a new development contract with James Tabor, a long time ReactOS developer that has worked extensively on the Win32 subsystem. Jim intends to tackle many of the longstanding bugs and hopefully significantly reduce the number of outstanding issues in the Win32 subsystem. This particular contract will have a heavy emphasis on bugfixing instead of attempting to introduce new features.

      <description>The ReactOS Project is happy to announce an extension to Edijs Kolesnikovics&#39;s contract for developing application tests using AutoHotkey. Amine Khaldi, the supervisor for the previous contract, was very satisfied with Edijs&#39; work and moved that an extension be made to give Edijs more time to develop additional tests. The first contract saw tests for installing applications and the exercising of some very basic functionality, as well as some improvements to the testing framework.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project once again had a presence at the Seliger Youth Forum held at Lake Seliger in Russia, with Marat Karatov and Alexander Rechitskiy representing the project. ReactOS ranked third overall of all projects presented at the Forum, but after Alexander and Marat had already left after having completed the presentation, the project was informed that the Forum wished to present the top projects to President Vladimir Putin. This caused some complications as Aleksey Bragin, the project coordinator, had been on vacation and could not make it back before the security lockdown.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project is proud to announce the first of the development&amp;nbsp;contracts that will be funded by the recent donation campaign. Edijs&amp;nbsp;Kolesnikovics joined the ReactOS development team very recently and&amp;nbsp;has been working extensively with Amine Khaldi and Olaf Siejka to&amp;nbsp;create an application test suite based around the AutoHotkey (AHK)&amp;nbsp;automation system. AutoHotkey is a tool for scripting keyboard and&amp;nbsp;mouse actions in order to automate running of programs on Windows.&amp;nbsp;While the current test suites exercise a considerable amount of&amp;nbsp;functionality, the true test for ReactOS remains when it is used to&amp;nbsp;run applications.</description>

      <description>The foundation of the internet are IP addresses, which tell people how to reach websites and machines across the world. The current iteration, IPv4, is 32bits in size and the world is quickly running out of available addresses. As such, there has been a steady march towards IPv6, which uses 128bits for addresses. This march has however been slow due to the massive existing infrastructure that uses IPv4. To try and help get more organizations IPv6 ready, the Internet Society set up IPv6 Launch Day, intended to be a day where participating organizations permanently turn on access over IPv6 to their services.</description>

      <description>Win32 Improvements Deep within GDI is code designed to carry out a series of raster operations that involve applying patterns to bitmaps. For performance reasons, it is desirable to have optimized versions of this code for the various bit depths. Formally, ReactOS only generated these optimized versions for the few ternary raster operations that were used often enough to be given a common name by Microsoft. The rest were handled in a single unoptimized version.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS Project has engaged in several fundraising efforts in the past, and thanks to their success and non-monetary donations, an industry-grade infrastructure was developed and deployed, and is being continuously improved.
Donations have also helped developers travel to several conferences and events to promote and present ReactOS. These presentations were crucial in drawing attention to the project and often helped spur further donations.
This year we want to do something different, something even grander.</description>

      <description>Session Manager Subsystem Rewrite The session manager subsystem is responsible for initializing much of the operating system environment and starting up services and processes needed to get a user to the login screen. Specifically, it creates the environment variables inherited by other processes, loads the Win32 subsystem, sets up the pagefiles for virtual memory, and finally starts up the winlogon.exe process, amongst other things. The implementation that was in ReactOS took many shortcuts in how it communicated with subsystem components, which in turn led to those components not correctly implementing the interfaces SMSS was supposed to use.</description>

While ReactOS maintains much of the development infrastructure internally now, SourceForge remains the host for all of our releases and helps provide another web presence for the project. Based on the stats, getting bumped to SourceForge&#39;s front page has drawn a fair amount of attention to the project.</description>

      <description>Wireless Cameron Gutman has spent the last month or so adding the pieces needed to support wireless network cards to ReactOS. A good portion of the work entailed writing the NDIS protocol driver (ndisuio) that handles sending wireless NDIS object identifier (OID) messages. These messages handle querying network drivers about their status and capabilities and also set the receiving mode the device should operate in. In addition to the kernel side, a user mode utility is needed to let end users actually make these requests.</description>

      <description>RPC Remote procedure calls underline a lot of things in Windows, especially services. Thus the Remote Procedure Call Runtime (rpcrt4) library is fairly important to the continued operation and stability of ReactOS. It is also a component in which the project is heavily reliant on Wine for. Unfortunately, just because Wine code works on Linux does not mean it will work on ReactOS, and attempts to sync rpcrt4 in the past have produced monumental headaches, breakages, and difficulties in ReactOS.</description>

      <description>Debugging is an important skill to have when developing large, complex pieces of software. The ReactOS project has a variety of resources and tools to help its developers identify problems. Several different debuggers are supported by the project and the operating system also generates debug messages that can be captured and viewed using a variety of methods. The below guides will show you how to set up ReactOS and the platform it is installed on to receive debug output as well as how to use a debugger to examine the executing code.</description>

      <description>ReactOS® is a free, modern operating system based on the design of Windows® XP/2003. Written completely from scratch, it aims to follow the Windows-NT® architecture designed by Microsoft from the hardware level right through to the application level. This is not a Linux based system, and shares none of the unix architecture. The main goal of the ReactOS project is to provide an operating system which is binary compatible with Windows.</description>

      <description>Preface The ReactOS&amp;trade; Project is an international group of developers whose goal is to create a work-alike version of the Microsoft Windows operating system. In light of recent activity in the free software world relating to copyright and patent concerns, the administrators of the ReactOS Project feel that a general guideline would be helpful for developers and potential contributors. For questions regarding this guideline, please e-mail Aleksey Bragin (project coordinator) or Ziliang Guo (document editor).</description>

      <description>I&#39;m currently working with the stylesheets. Here are my findings: Change Filereactos-style.css [Selector] #block-system-main-menu ul.menu text-align: center; (change to left) margin-left:0px; (change to 230px;) or optionally, create a new reactos-menu-style.css and recreate all the above to override the system stylesheet in zen. Fix 1: Handles all menus and may be detrimental to others. Fix 2: Handles only the reactos main menu. But, means another css to work with. Either way an issue.</description>

      <description>The German ING-DiBa AG bank is running a competition which people have until November 15th to vote on which foundation they support. The top 1000 foundations will receive a 1000€ donation from the bank. At the time of writing the ReactOS Foundation is sitting at 9th place, but three weeks is a long time for other projects to catch up and perhaps even bump ReactOS from the top 1000. Instructions for how to vote are located here and requires only an email.</description>

      <description>Shell32 Another recent accomplishment by Claudiu Mihail, the Google Summer of Code responsible for transforming the lwIP library into a driver, was the completion and remerging of the shell32 library as C++ code instead of C code. The effort was started originally by Ged Murphy and Andrew Hill as C++ was better suited to implementing the COM aspects of the library. Ged had originally tried to do the conversion in trunk, but that proved too disruptive and he moved the code into a branch.</description>

      <description>ReactOS Demonstrated to the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev The ReactOS project participated in the Seliger 2011 Forum this summer. &#34;Seliger&#34; is an annual youth educational forum held since 2005 at Lake Seliger in Russia, close to the city of Ostashkov in the Tver region (370km away from Moscow). The forum is funded by the Russian government with a budget of approximately 178 million rubles (approximately 5.9 million dollars or 4.3 million euros).</description>

      <description>Google Summer of Code Progress Of the six projects ReactOS entered as part of the Google Summer of Code, four are well on track to completion. Each of the completed projects will greatly help increase ReactOS&#39; usability and provide a foundation for future enhancement. Many of the successful projects will help make ReactOS more usable from both a stability and UI perspective. The deadline for final submissions is already over and the project and Google are currently evaluating students.</description>

      <description>MSVC Progress The entirety of ReactOS can now be built using Microsoft&#39;s compiler, but running the resulting operating system is still a ways off. &amp;nbsp;Timo Kreuzer has already squashed several bugs that arose, one such being corruption of filesystem metadata that caused the loading of freeldr to fail. On x86/x64 platforms, part of the booting process involves the bootsector loading in the FAT table from disk, which needs to be loaded in a high enough address that reading freeldr into memory afterward would not overwrite the table.</description>

      <description>Theme Support Giannis has completed support for drawing in most non-client areas of a window such as captions, borders, and scrollbars. Scrollbars turned out to be especially problematic as the code that handles calculations of how much to scroll is also responsible for redrawing the changes. This has the very unfortunate consequence of duplicating a significant amount of drawing code inside the scrolling update function. Maintenance of this code will likely be troublesome due to this, but currently Giannis is not aware of a way around the problem.</description>

      <description>Loader Rewrite When an application has external dependencies that are in DLLs, a loader is responsible for loading and initializing them. The implementation in ReactOS is very, very old and like many such instances of ancient code incorrect. It worked after a fashion but took many shortcuts. There are matters such as initialization of the Thread Local Storage, calling the DllMain of a specific DLL, and loading of DLLs in the correct order based on interdependencies or even circular dependencies.</description>

      <description>GDI Memory Usage As part of his work rewriting the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handle manager, Timo Kreuzer ran across what can only be described as an atrocious waste of memory. The memory allocation granularity for when objects were created was an entire page, 4KB, regardless of whether an object needed that much space to store its attributes. This thus wastes a considerable amount of memory and also eats up memory addresses.</description>

      <description>NewCC Status A while back Art Yerkes merged in a significant part of his new common cache implementation into trunk. This merge was intended to lay the foundation for the eventual replacement of the current common cache, which will happen once Art clears up some inconsistencies in how the sections data structure is treated by the memory manager and the common cache. Sections management is the responsibility of the memory manager but provide functionality the common cache relies on.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS team is proud to announce the release of ReactOS 0.3.13. This version continues building on the work first previewed in 0.3.12, ranging from memory management improvements to better sound and display control. A Coverity scan also occurred between 0.3.12 and 0.3.13, helping the team clean up potential security holes and also help improve general stability by enforcing more care in memory operations.
Some of the biggest system changes happened with memory management with the introduction of a new heap manager based on the Windows 2003/Vista architecture, significantly increasing ReactOS’ compatibility with advanced memory allocation types and providing proper kernel mode heap management used by win32k.</description>

      <description>We are proud to announce that ReactOS has been accepted into the 2011 Google Summer of Code program. It has been a few years since we were last a part of the program, so we are keen to use this opportunity not only to benefit ReactOS in hopefully gaining new features, but in passing on our knowledge to bright and prospective students with an interest in operating system development and especially Windows internals.</description>

      <description>C++ Mangling Those with any experience using third party libraries while writing C++ applications should quickly recognize the topic I am about to go over and can skip down to paragraph three for the ReactOS specific miseries. Those that are not familiar with the issues or want a refresher should continue. The C++ standard outlines behavior for C++ code when compiled. To be considered a compliant compiler requires following the specifications laid out, though no compiler that I am aware of actually implements 100% of the entire standard.</description>

      <description>Component Testing As more components relating to filesystems sees implementation in ReactOS, they need to be tested. Pierre Schweitzer decided to try using Microsoft&#39;s FASTFAT driver to help in the effort, as using it successfully in ReactOS would indicate development is on the right track. Unfortunately, ReactOS&#39; current common cache implementation effectively blocks that attempt due to its sorry state. The common cache has been touched upon in the past and mention was made of its problems.</description>

      <description>Donators page is back on track As of today, the Donators page which lists all monetary donations to the project is back on track.
The long outage originated from the fact that all donations are handled by the German non-profit organization ReactOS Deutschland e.V. as of 2010. This change has required a new software for creating the donation list, which has needed some time to mature.
Gladly, this long development time has paid off and updating the donation list is now just a matter of a few clicks.</description>

Coverity Redux The ReactOS team recently ran another Coverity scan on the source code. While a few new issues were discovered thanks to enhancements to Coverity&#39;s analysis program, the vast majority of issues fell into two categories; false positives due to the way the Portable Structured Exception Handling (PSEH) library is implemented and used, and warnings from third party code not developed by this project.</description>

      <description>Sound Stack
 The sound stack on Windows has a fairly clearcut layout, but the explanation provided in issue 65 of the newsletter was very brief and likely confusing so a more complete explanation follows. The sound card on a computer deals with two types of lines, source and destination. Source lines are effectively inputs from various things like the CD-ROM, microphone, or the like. Destination lines are ouputs from the card to speakers, headphones, and such.</description>

      <description>0.3.12 As one can see from the front page, 0.3.12 has been released into the wild. In many ways 0.3.12 provides more a transitional view of ReactOS development than presenting loads and loads of new features or functionality. The 10 months between it and 0.3.11 provided a long window in which developers could drop in new features. Unfortunately many of them promised to be extremely disruptive and the decision was made to disable the full functionality of several before shipping.</description>

      <description>The ReactOS team is proud to announce the release of ReactOS 0.3.12. This is a huge release for the team, not just with regards to the number of improvements which this release holds but in terms of the leap forward architecturally, stability wise and in bringing some of the more modern aspects of the NT kernel into ReactOS. It&#39;s been almost a year since the last release and whilst this is understandably excessive, it was required to stabilize the OS due to the nature of the work which was undertaken.</description>

      <description>Hunting Dangling Pointers
 There has always been a suspicion and concern amongst the ReactOS developers that there are points of sloppiness in ReactOS with respect to memory management. These can be fairly innocuous when at the user mode level, but in kernel mode can lead to data corruption and other problems. Cameron Gutman, Timo Kreuzer, and Michael Martin have just managed to find and fix what was perhaps the most serious of these suspected leaks.</description>

Bitmap Drawing Bitmaps are more or less the primary medium through which the Win32 subsystem draws things. However, the term refers to more than just the widely used format for images and the like. That format is generally considered a device independent bitmap (DIB). With a device independent version there of course exists a device dependent one, which is the format that a particular graphics device supports for drawing.</description>

      <description>General Developments Amine Khaldi&#39;s effort in getting the driver headers cleaned up is starting to show results. Not only are a good portion of the driver headers sorted out, the necessary checks have been added to allow the headers to be used in both MSVC and GCC. Anyone who has had to write cross platform code will know that the two compilers have subtle differences at times in their allowed syntax so producing code that works with both can get nontrivial quickly.</description>

General Developments A few weeks back Aleksey Bragin directed the developers to take a look at a long list of regressions that had accumulated. Individually the problems were for the most part minor, though a few were near show stoppers. However, cumulatively they represented a major perception problem in ReactOS&#39; progress.</description>

      <description>NT USB Stack Pre-Vista, the USB architecture started with a very low level usbport driver. This driver was the one that created device objects for each USB controller and received I/O Request Packets (IRP). Depending on which USB standard the controllers were for, usbport would call into one of three helper drivers, usbehci, usbohci, and usbuhci. The one actually sending those IRPs was usbhub, and these components constitute the lower levels of the USB stack.</description>

      <description>UniATA Timing UniATA continues to be problematic, with testers often struggling to get past the first stage install much less actually put ReactOS through its paces. As mentioned before, the time UniATA waits for responses from hardware is considerably lower than that of the old ATA driver. On older hardware, sometimes various drives are not fast enough in responding so operations time out and UniATA reports an error even when there technically was nothing wrong.</description>

      <description>Trap Handling One of the ways low level communication with hardware is handled is with interrupts and exceptions. Code still has to be written to deal with these and that code is in the trap handler. The original trap handler code in ReactOS was pure assembly, which to an extent is inevitable due to the very needing to carry out operations that the C language does not specify a method for.</description>

      <description>ARWINSS, Third Time&#39;s the Charm, Maybe There has been increasing speculation on what ARWINSS is, on what it is for, and on what it does, despite several statements released by Aleksey Bragin. The speculation has reached the point where people with incomplete information are making assertions as if they were fact when often their assertions are incorrect. ARWINSS is not intended to &#39;replace&#39; the current Win32 subsystem. It exists as a parallel effort to overcome the limitations in the current Win32 subsystem by applying a different design instead of duplicating the one in Windows NT.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.11 Released The ReactOS team is proud to announce the release of ReactOS 0.3.11. This release has been delayed by quite some time due to various blocker bugs which manifested each time we tried to release. A lot of time has gone into hunting down these bugs and various steps have been taken to try to ensure we don&#39;t hit this problem again. This isn&#39;t to say we don&#39;t have a lot of new and exciting features in this release.</description>

      <description>Debugging The last time WinDBG support was discussed up was nearly a year ago. The first step needed was a kernel compatible with WinDBG, which was achieved by the kernel rewrite that mostly concluded two years ago. The required features mostly revolved around dealing with an executing thread&#39;s context and reading virtual memory. While the kernel rewrite made these possible, a few bugs prevented their usage. Debugging requires interrupting the executing thread&#39;s flow but also restoring it to allow the program to continue.</description>

      <description>FAT
 A short while ago the FullFAT library was mentioned on the ReactOS forum and then brought to the attention of the developers by IRC regulars. Written by James Walmsley, it is a platform independent library for accessing FAT12/16/32 partitions and it was suggested that a new IFS driver could be written using it. The current FAT driver was written against an older, less NT compliant kernel and was never extensively tested on Windows to begin with.</description>

      <description>Disks and Partitions One of the non-cross platform aspects of ReactOS was in how the bootloader dealt with disks and partitions. The naming scheme used was very x86 centric and also was limited in which partitions it could access. Herv&amp;eacute; Poussineau started working on a new API to remove the limitations, one based on names instead of drive numbers. Previously on platforms like PPC and ARM, developers would have needed to give numbers to each storage device they wanted to use.</description>

      <description>Color and Filling Colored cursors aren&#39;t a feature used that often by regular applications, but games certainly make use of it and Winamp is a non-game example. When using Winamp, Gregor Schneider noticed the mouse turned into a black box when he tried to use it and dug into the code to see if he could fix it. In several places were comments noting the need for color support so Gregor had a few hints about where additional code was needed.</description>

      <description>Test Disruptions For several days the automated testing suite that runs every ReactOS revision got stuck in an infinite loop once it reached the msi_winetest. Several people following the testing noticed this issue and suggested possible causes but Jeffrey Morlan eventually committed a patch that seems to resolve it. The problem appeared to be in the LoadLibraryExW function, in a specific case where the LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE flag was set. The function received as one of its inputs DllName, the name of the library it was being asked to load.</description>

      <description>PSEH Corruption In NT operating systems, structured exception handling is used to help safeguard probing of user mode memory buffers and pageable memory while in kernel mode. This requirement was what motivated the creation of the PSEH library by KJK::Hyperion since GCC does not have support for it. Since the last attempt to add SEH support to GCC failed, ReactOS remains dependent on PSEH. Recently, the ARM team committed some code which exposed a very nasty bug in the PSEH library and investigation of the issue led KJK to discover another bug while analyzing the code.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.10 Released The ReactOS team is proud to announce the release of ReactOS 0.3.10. This version is the first to use the Universal ATA driver as the default disk driver, adding support for Serial ATA and partitions greater than 8GB. In addition, recent work was done on the USB stack to increase compatibility with USB keyboards and mice. These features are still under heavy development and have several known bugs, but their inclusion should allow more people to run ReactOS on real hardware and are part of the extensive work to make ReactOS usable as an every day operating system.</description>

      <description>0.3.10 Preparations  Effort is underway to get the 0.3.10 release out the door. Testers have been going through the usual list of applications to find any regressions and several have popped up. An especially nasty one was a seemingly random data corruption in the Download application, eventually traced back to an update in wininet from Wine. As the developers were unable to pinpoint the exact cause, Cameron Gutman simply reverted the entire code synchronization.</description>

      <description>RBuild and MSVC  Getting ReactOS built using Microsoft&amp;#39;s compilers has been on the wishlist of several ReactOS developers, but no one really wanted to deal with the monstrosity that RBuild had transformed into. KJK::Hyperion decided his sanity was sufficient enough to survive the experience and has been working for quite some time to get it to be able to use a compiler that is not GCC. So far, his additions allow RBuild to detect the presence of the VC++ compiler, whether you got it through Visual Studio, one of the SDKs, or the WDK.</description>

The Foundation itself has been established for a few years now and is based in Moscow, but two recent developments have helped increase its legitimacy in a broader perspective. The first was the approval of ReactOS as a registered trademark owned by the Foundation in Russia.</description>

      <description>UniATA  The Universal ATA driver has often been pointed out as a way to solve some rather annoying issues in ReactOS, such as the lack of support for SATA and limiting the amount of space ROS sees to about 8GB. Since both issues border on the outright absurd in this day and age, fixing them was of very high priority. A few showstoppers stood in the way however of switching over permanently and Aleksey Bragin has managed to resolve some of them.</description>

      <description>VBox Video Driver  A while back the VBox video driver started working in ReactOS, which meant people using VirtualBox could now get hardware acceleration for graphics. To make the driver usable, Timo Kreuzer fixed two things in the Win32 subsystem. While the driver ran before the fixes, its functionality was somewhat crippled and drawing often resulted in problems. The first fix was for the mouse pointer, or more specifically drawing the mouse pointer moving across the screen.</description>

      <description>USB  USB support has an odd history in ReactOS. The original effort involved porting the Cromwell USB stack from Linux, which Aleksey Bragin spent awhile trying to get working. This was eventually abandoned for another third party project, an USB stack developed for NT4 by a programmer in China. This stack however was incomplete and rather buggy and the original author no longer maintained it so Aleksey spent some time fixing it up, to an extent.</description>

      <description>Font Engine  There is a difference between functional correctness and implementation correctness, a distinction one always has to keep in mind when saying something works in ReactOS. In the case of text rendering, while the output may for the most part look correct, the underlying implementation is nothing like how it should be. The abbreviated function call chain for displaying text is TextOutA/W, NtGdiExtTextOutW, and GreExtTextOutW. There are a few variations but the above provides a general idea of the path down to the Gre function.</description>

      <description>Memory Usage  The minimum required memory for ReactOS has been creeping up for some time now, mainly due to the installer. In general, the developers knew that the memory required by ROS after the install was nowhere as high as during the install. Most assumed there was some kind of memory leakage happening, whether it be in the installer or even in the memory manager. It was an issue many people wanted addressed but it wasn&amp;#39;t until Alex Ionescu took a look that the problem was resolved.</description>

      <description>More Win32 Work  Timo Kreuzer continues his efforts to make the Win32 subsystem more correct, recently working on the functions SetWindowExtEx and SetViewpointExtEx. The first step was moving it out of win32k, where the operations were originally being carried out, and into gdi32, where they should be carried out. Jim Tabor had code in place which implemented them, but they needed some fixing. While not yet complete, Timo has corrected some of the errors.</description>

      <description>Year in Review  2008 saw a total of four point releases by the ReactOS project, all of which were made after the kernel rewrite was completed. Thus the instabilities people saw in the 0.3.1 release were greatly reduced and there were better rates of success in running ROS on real hardware and not just virtual machines. That is not to say the system runs reliably, but we have gotten closer.</description>

      <description>The Perils of PSEH2  While KJK did get PSEH2 out in record time, this meant that it was relatively untested when he committed it and developers began using it. Currently PSEH seems to be corrupting data when exceptions get thrown, which then cascades down and causes functions to assert and crash, something that it was supposed to prevent. Michael Martin&amp;#39;s theory about what is happening is that PSEH is clobbering local variables that are being held in registers, though KJK attributes it to an issue of not using setjmp.</description>

      <description>Network Configuration  Johannes Anderwald has been working to fix a persistent bug in the network settings that resulted after he reimplemented the network configuration and settings dialog in netcfgx.dll using COM interfaces. Johannes also had to implement the COM interfaces, since they didn&#39;t exist before, and they are now in netshell.dll. Unfortunately, it seems that the dhcpclient was storing settings in the wrong registry key, which resulted in failure to retrieve DNS information and crashing of applications that relied on such information.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.7 Released  Version 0.3.7 got delayed due to a couple of blocker bugs, however they are fixed now and we are ready to release.  This release along with the rest of the 0.3.x series is still considered alpha quality software.  ReactOS 0.3.7 continues further work on the main three principles of current ReactOS development: bugfixes, compatibility and stability. Changes summaryA consolidation of all changes in great details can be found in the changelog.</description>

      <description>General Developments  The release was delayed to take care of a series of regressions. That and I was busy so the changelog itself wasn&amp;#39;t ready either. Anyways, every time a branch is created, Colin Finck, the release engineer, puts up a build and our team of testers run it through its paces and see if any applications that worked in the past got broken. If that happens, effort is made to fix the regression.</description>

      <description>General Developments  The developers have been quite busy over the past month, each chugging away at their respective spots. Cameron Gutman continues filling in holes in our networking code, while Ged Murphy is putting together headers for the user mode side of networking. Samuel Serapion and Timo Kreuzer are still working on the x64 branch, fixing compile errors and warnings as they go. We&#39;ve also had a few discussions with the mingw64 people about what&#39;s missing on both ends to get ReactOS to run as a proper x64 OS.</description>

      <description>Shellfolder Extensions  All of the special folders such as control panel, printer folder, and administrative tools are actually shellfolder extensions that the Explorer shell implements using IShellFolder. Johannes Anderwald has been implementing those still missing in ReactOS as well as extending and fixing others. Two new ones are the Font folder and the Administrative Tools folder. Johannes also implemented the dialog for formating drives, but this obviously isn&amp;#39;t functional.  The Recycle Bin was also fixed with help from Herv&amp;eacute; Poussineau, as previously several issues in Trash_CanTrashFile prevented files from being moved there.</description>

      <description>LinuxWorld Report  For the past week, Art Yerkes has been representing ReactOS at the Linux World Convention in California.&amp;nbsp; He was unfortunately the only ReactOS developer or community member that could make it, but things seem to have turned out well.&amp;nbsp; In the process of preparing for the convention, Art stumbled over an issue with drive letters that I will cover later.&amp;nbsp; This forced him to rely on running ReactOS in QEMU, which actually turned out nicely.</description>

      <description>General Development  There was an interesting bug involving handle creation a while back. When creating the 4100th handle, the system would crash. This bug was exposed through VLC and was eventually fixed by Christoph von Wittich. The problem was the result of an incorrect calculation, where the code attempted to access an index higher than 4099 on the first table. Such values are out of bounds and are supposed to be found in the second table and higher.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.6 Released  In a little over a month since version 0.3.5, we are announcing the release ReactOS 0.3.6.  This release along with the rest of the 0.3.x series is still considered alpha quality software, so do not set your expectations too high.  ReactOS 0.3.6 is the product of the current development focus: bugfixes, compatibility, and stability.

      <description>0.3.5 Release  Obviously the release has gone out and we are receiving the usual reports of problems and successes. The biggest problem seems to be an issue people are having with Qemu on Vista, at least the Qemu version we prepackaged. This is not really a problem with ReactOS itself, but with the emulator software. For people who have encountered this, we suggest using the 0.9.0 builds instead of the 0.</description>

This release, along with the rest of the 0.3.x series is still considered alpha quality software, so do not set your expectations too high.  ReactOS 0.3.5 release contains fixes for many old bugs, some having been present since 0.3 or even earlier and some being regressions introduced in further releases due to rewrites of certain components, not to mention new features.</description>

      <description>Various Matters  The project&#39;s been dealing with some internal matters recently and this combined with my day job being at the same time the majority of developers are online means I wasn&#39;t fully up to date on development matters and was busy dealing with other matters. Due to various issues and my lack of time recently, it&#39;s taken this long to get one out. We did have a second person who volunteered to write something up and the basic information in this newsletter is from his draft.</description>

      <description>Just a reminder that there really isn&amp;#39;t any set schedule for newsletters anymore. We (or at least I) publish whenever there&amp;#39;s something to report, and boy do we have a lot of ground to cover. The past few weeks have been very eventful. 0.3.5 and Development Focus  Amongst the developers, the joke was that Aleksey&amp;#39;s vacation delayed the release, so it was his fault that we&amp;#39;re behind. Now, it is Aleksey&amp;#39;s fault, but for a different reason.</description>

      <description>Microsoft DirectX Runtime  First, let me state that legally, according to the whole Windows Genuine Advantage and EULA, you&amp;#39;re not supposed to install the MS DirectX runtime on nongenuine Windows systems. On the other hand, the runtimes that come with various games as a prerequisite to playing the game aren&amp;#39;t technically bound by the WGA. That aside, the MS DirectX runtime now loads on ReactOS. To get DX on, you need to manually copy the following files: dxg.</description>

      <description>New project of ReactOS Foundation  Our russian department launched a new service for opensource projects hosting: FireForge.net. This site provides file releases, SVN/CVS, web, ftp hosting, bug/feature trackers, mailing lists and everything else needed for building a successive opensource community. A difference from similar known sites like sf.net or code.google.com is that FireForge.net provides hosting services for projects interested for russian audience, and it&amp;#39;s not just about providing services, but it&amp;#39;s about providing a way for new projects to become known quicker, attract interested users and developers.</description>

      <description>General Status  We&amp;#39;re currently in the middle of compiling the changelog, but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean we&amp;#39;re ready for release.  The keyboard/mouse problem has slowly been worked out and according to Colin Finck it is now fixed. If you still encounter problems, complain to him, not me.&amp;nbsp; The issue with the keyboard not responding during language selection should now be gone and was due to the keyboard driver not loading properly.</description>

      <description>Server maintenance   Recent server maintenance caused outages of the web and SVN servers. The ordeal lasted a few hours for some users, which could not access the project web page, SVN servers, or send mail to the mailing lists. If you sent an email to our mailing list during the outage your mail could have bounced, or have been lost. Don&amp;#39;t believe the conspiracy theories, it was just a DNS change.</description>

      <description>0.3.4 Release  0.3.4 was released a few weeks back. While it has seen some major improvements, the mouse/keyboard bug wasn&amp;#39;t completely squashed in the release. However, it has been fixed in trunk by Aleksey, so all of you can stop complaining about it. On the other hand, people are reporting some major speed increases with this release. Thomas Bluemel&amp;#39;s work on the desktop heap and Jim Tabor&amp;#39;s work in deferring switchs between user and kernel mode seem to be paying off.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.4 Released  We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of ReactOS in the 0.3 series. This is a culmination of the last 3 months of development, and some significant progress has been made in various areas. Release cycle  Starting from version 0.3.3 we have aimed to move our release cycle to a 2 month period. There are various reasons for this, but the two which are key to this decision is a desire to keep the main development tree in a stable condition, and an effort to keep up the interests of the people who follow the project, by providing regular release builds to play with.</description>

      <description>General Developments  Aleksey and Herve have been working on the PnP problem, which many people are experiencing through the unresponsive mouse or keyboard. At least some of the problem&amp;#39;s been fixed, since people seem to have better success. In an attempt to squash the rest of the bug, Aleksey is updating the Remote Procedure Call code in ROS. Also, a working RPC would also allow WIDL, our substitute for MIDL (Microsoft Interface Definition Language), a method for software components written in different programming languages to communicate, to finally work.</description>

ReactOS 0.3.4 promises to improve on 0.3.3 by working on more hardware, running even more applications, being faster and more stable than ever before. Even so many of the same old restrictions apply. We thank everyone who has helped make this release possible.</description>

      <description>A rare joint newsletter between Samuel and I. General Changes  Some people have already noticed the inclusion of a new remote desktop utility, mstsc.exe, by Ged. Some asked why include this new tool when there is already such a client in SVN, albeit incomplete. The reasoning is simple. The author of the old client has been gone a while and Ged is not familiar with his code, so he chose to use something else.</description>

      <description>Status Update  ReactOS had quite a few major improvements since the last 0.3.3 release, and I feel this needs to be given a special attention. Kernel First of all, the kernel gets mostly bugfixes in all areas, especially which haven&#39;t been touched for a long time (Cache controller, for example), leading to great improvements in compatibility+stability. A number of issues with Win32 applications crashing went away. Drivers Then, drivers. Input stack was rewritten to be plug&#39;n&#39;play compatible, USB is on its way to be PnPised, PCI bus driver bugfixed resulting in better hardware support.</description>

      <description>Les Trophees du Libre  Les Trophees du Libre is a contest for free software, divided into six categories. ReactOS has entered the contest, in the science category. At first glance that might seem odd, but LinuxBIOS is also in that category. However, it&#39;s not LinuxBIOS we should be worried about. The competition from the other projects is going to be rough. We&#39;re facing mathematical libraries, pattern recognition, even bioinformatics. Still, with a grand prize of 3000 euros, it&#39;s definitely worth a shot.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.3 Released!  As we have previously made you aware, we skipped the 0.3.2 release due to massive problems with old incompatible drivers resulting in blocker bugs we couldn&#39;t resolve within the scheduled release time. With these issues now resolved, and along with a extensive amount of additional improvements, we are presenting the next minor release - 0.3.3  This is still labeled as alpha-stage release, so do not set your expectations too high: translating into a non-programmer’s language alpha-stage means: “You are lucky if it actually installs and runs for you outside of a virtual machine”.</description>

      <description>This newsletter is late because I ran into a permissions conflict with RosCMS. Others who have also run into it, frik is fixing it tomorrow.  Win32k Rewrite   Samuel mentioned this last time and I spoke with the developers responsible to get more details. Jim Tabor, Timo Kreuzer, and Magnus Olsen have been working extensively to redo the win32k subsystem. The biggest thing is duplicating the behavior of Windows&amp;#39; win32k.</description>

So if you have built mingw32 for your mac and would like to build ReactOS in your mac you can. The primary difficulties lay in some wchar defines and iswdigit function and where fixed relatively easily. Win32k  The all important graphical subsystem continues its march to becoming the fully featured, safe and performing beast it should be.</description>

      <description>New RosCMS v3 online The ReactOS Content Management System software for the ReactOS website got a major update. RosCMS is used to manage the ReactOS website and in near future additionally to maintain the ReactOS translation work. It is a very flexible web based system. The core parts of the software are the flexible database layout and the dynamic interface that consist of a bunch of filters. The end user can costumize his/her own workflow by changing the filter settings or choose one of the predefined views (which consist itself of filters internally).</description>

      <description>Release time The long awaited 0.3.3 release is branched; the usual preparations for releases are under way. You should already know we skipped a version number and that this release is primarily bug fixes from the massive kernel rewrites that have been taking place. Stability being the primary motivation of this release, I can safely say this is a big improvement from the 0.3.1 release. The outlook looks bright on future releases, ever closer to the 0.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.3 RC1 The release candidate was more or less a success, far more than what many of us expected. When bug reports started coming in from people running it on real hardware, several of us, including myself, were quite surprised. Having a stabilized kernel definitely helps. The RC was released for several reasons. First, ReactOS suddenly got a surge of attention over the past two weeks, resulting in people going and downloading our latest release.</description>

      <description>Bug Hunt  The past few weeks have seen quite a lot of activity.&amp;nbsp; At least six major blocker bugs were dealt with, ranging from the network issue to various bugs in the command line console.&amp;nbsp; The pre VMware Workstation 6 Display Driver also now installs and works, which opens up some interesting possibilities.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, on VMware Workstation, the driver allows the use of DirectX or ReactX.&amp;nbsp; Which means Magnus Olsen&#39;s work on ReactX can actually be demo&#39;ed on Workstation, to an extent.</description>

      <description>Forget 0.3.2  We promised a release period of two months, but all the kinks are not out yet. More than 2 months have passed and project leaders have decided that there are already enough changes in trunk to call it 0.3.3, the next release. This is a sign that development, although a bit hard to manage, is moving at faster rates. As development approaches 0.4.0 goals we would see increasing functionality and stability, as well as keeping in line with the best practices in software development, testing and compatibility.</description>

      <description>Update on ReactOS internals 0.3.2 Release  ReactOS 0.3.2 is officially going to be skipped (due to 4 blocker bugs), and ReactOS 0.3.3 will be the next in the cycle which, according to the 2 months release schedule,&amp;nbsp;will be released in July. Trunk already has many improvements and bugfixes for 0.3.3, however we are still working on fixing those 4 major issues.   Team  Alex Ionescu left the ReactOS team to follow an exciting career opportunity working with David Solomon as an official replacement to&amp;nbsp;Mark Russinovich Our best wishes to him at his new position, and a big thanks for all the great work he has done for ReactOS.</description>

      <description>In theory, I shouldn&#39;t be writing this edition. In reality, I got tired of waiting for Samuel to get this out. Thank You Alex For those that don&#39;t know, Alex Ionescu, the kernel coordinator, has resigned.&amp;nbsp; Alex first joined the project in 2004, around the 0.2.2 release.&amp;nbsp; Since then, he&#39;s been at the center of quite a few squabbles about how to code the kernel.&amp;nbsp; However, Alex has also been responsible for completely rewriting the kernel almost from the ground up.</description>

      <description>Just to make it clear, while we aim for a biweekly newsletter, we only aim for it to be up around Sunday. It can easily be delayed if there isn&#39;t enough to talk about. The Road to 0.3.2 For those of you who don&#39;t follow the ReactOS scene closely it may be hard to know what exactly is happening in terms of development progress. The technical nature of some improvements also proves confusing to most people.</description>

      <description>0.3.1 Released! After months of discussions, testing and of course mountains of code, it&amp;rsquo;s finally here! The official release announcement was made by our project coordinator. This release has many deep down changes that may not be comprehensible to most users, but most users will in fact notice improved stability and speed. The changelog will tell you about these changes in technical terms, but the best testimony would be your own tests.</description>

      <description>ReactOS 0.3.1 Released! It&#39;s been almost half a year since the last release (0.3.0). And all this time work was going on like crazy - sometimes up to 50 commits per day. Mainly, the work focused on rewriting certain parts of the ReactOS Core (kernel, HAL, bootloader, etc). It&#39;s very hard to sum up&amp;nbsp;the huge Changelog&amp;nbsp;in an outline, but briefly:
 Freeldr was improved HAL&#39;s key areas&amp;nbsp;have been&amp;nbsp;significantly improved (irql-related, bus support, kd-functions) The Kernel experienced a massive rewrite of incompatible parts (and is still in the process of improvement) Run-time library (Rtl)&amp;nbsp;got a lot of improvements and bugfixes Bugs were fixed in kernel-mode drivers&amp;nbsp;and a better USB driver was added Registry-support&amp;nbsp;has been&amp;nbsp;greatly improved thanks to addition of&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;cmlib&amp;quot;, a library shared by the boot loader and the kernel to handle&amp;nbsp;binary registry hives; it even supports binary registry hives created by Windows More fixes in the Win32 subsystem and user-mode DLLs Boot video&amp;nbsp;driver (and a splash screen) was added  Read through the changelog, and you will see the amount of changes in this release!</description>

      <description>FOSDEM 2007 event in Brussels FOSDEM&amp;nbsp;turned out to be a big great event indeed.
I was just back from the event yesterday, and after having some rest I&#39;m writing this news. This was my first time attending FOSDEM, and first time speaking at FOSDEM. I should say, FOSDEM&#39;s staff organized everything very well, the room(Janson)given for ReactOS talk was huge (and the space was not wasted ;)), the hotel was quite perfect and very well situated (despite it&#39;s far from the ULB, where the event took place, they provided a nice Taxi service).</description>

ReactOS will still be alpha, unstable and not recommended for everyday use. If you&#39;re really hardcore you&#39;ll try out the SVN versions. I can say that 0.3.1 will be a VERY significant improvement from 0.3.0, when we can finally get it to run on your PC.

There have been many queries about it in the chat rooms and forums. Well, the problem is actually rather simple. The developers have decided that releases should be made every month, or at an appropriate time where in trunk or a designated branch is reasonably usable and showcases the progress of the ReactOS project.</description>

However, I was too busy with the projects I was doing (mostly in game development area) and thus did not really search for already existing projects of this kind.</description>

We had to change really a lot of stuff, to make future transfers easier, to prevent&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;slashdotting&amp;quot; and thus some of you experienced problems using the website or services during the transfer period. I am very pleased to announce that now everything is in place and is expected to work as it always did.</description>

      <description>Hello, There has been a lot of talk about possible tainted code in ReactOS and or developers that had access to leaked Microsoft source code. This has caused a lot of speculation about the future of the ReactOS Project. I&#39;m going to try to put those fears to rest and explain what has been going on and where we are going to go from here.  There was one issue that started this discussion and it related to clean-room reverse engineering of certain code in ReactOS.</description>

Unfortunately, I was a little bit busier over the holiday period than I had anticipated, but now that I&#39;m back doing early shifts, instead of the late ones I was being handed, I will have enough time set aside to continue.
So, I&#39;ll start as I mean to go on... by Compiling! Yep, ReactOS&#39; Source Code may be all-singing, all-dancing, bu without it being compiled, all it does it look like a pretty collection of ASCII Codes.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks, TwoTailedFox here, just giving you guys the rundown on what&#39;s happenning with the Newsletter.
Unfortunately, I was busier than I&#39;d intended to be over Christmas and New Years. Being given lots of long shifts bunched together is a sure-fire way for me to feel very, very tired.
Newsletter contents for Issue 10 have been finalised, and I&#39;ve jotted down every relevent SVN update since the 13th of December. All that needs to be done is add lots of pretty formatting, and pray it&#39;s flawless first time around.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year! 2005 was a great year for ReactOS.
The following facts came from the SVN server (thanks to Casper Hornstrup):
 The core ReactOS code base is now 120MB large. The repository is currently 624MB large and contains ~20500 revisions. ~8000 of these revisions were created in 2005. This mean 39% of the total number of revisions created during ReactOS&#39; entire 8 year history was created in 2005!  ReactOS Website facts:</description>

      <description>Issue 9 of the Newsletter has landed There are very few things that irritate me. Windows XP playing havock with my mouse cursor ranks among them. Thus, a reformat and reload ensues. And to top it all off, I have a PSU that&#39;s as dodgy as an SCO-Endorsed Lawsuit. For some strange reason, one of my Hard Drives will have its power drop out, which causes my drive to spin down, that acts like a domino toppling, and causes my system to hang.</description>

My plan was to start it with an information in the ReactOS IRC Web Channel (#reactos-web). The idea was to allow a small group of translators to translate ReactOS web contents with the RosCMS interface. Now, some interface bugs has been fixed and a lot of translated web contents has been added to the database (thanks to all contributors/translators).</description>

      <description>Welcome To Reality Welcome to the ReactOS Weekly Newsletter, Issue 8, where there are three kinds of people, none of them particularly effective at writing a newsletter today.
The Delay: Excuses Inbound Unfortunately, Issue 8 was delayed last week, because Mrs. Flu decided to bed me over, and screw me crosseyed, leaving me very ill, and making my body wish it had a built-in thermostat. Anyway, it&#39;s better to have a newsletter late, than not at all, so let&#39;s just jump straight to it.</description>

      <title>ReactOS Website Update</title>

      <description>ReactOS Website Update The ability to browse through the newsletters and news entries wasn&#39;t so easy. I got response from several visitors. In conclusion, they prefer a WineHQ newsletter style layout.
I rewrote the newsletter and news interface and add a ReactOS News Feed (RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0).
Everything is available on the website frontpage!
If you have ideas or suggestion about the website please use the ReactOS Forums and/or the ReactOS Wiki.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Issue 7 of the ReactOS Weekly Newsletter, as persistant as a Jehovah&#39;s Witness. This week, I&#39;ll be taking a look at the NDK used by the ReactOS Developers, covering WINE 0.9.2, and detailing the latest SVN activity.
NDK: What it does, and why it&#39;s needed &amp;quot;What is the NDK designed to do?&amp;quot;, I hear you ask. Well, first off, a little bit of it&#39;s history. The NDK stands for Native Development Kit, and was the brainchild of Alex Ionescu, as a way of allowing Windows and ReactOS developers alike to have access to a wealth of undocumented kernel and native structures and function prototype.</description>

      <description>ReactOS Weekly Newsletter Volume 1, Issue 5 The Number keeps creeping up, and I believe, with this Issue, the ReactOS Weekly Newsletter equals the amount of editions Splash, the former ReactOS Newsletter, released
Freeloader: What is it? Freeloader (abbreviated freeldr [Why is abbreviated such a long word? -Ed.]), is the ReactOS Bootloader, licensed under the GPL.
What does it do?  It parses the ReactOS registry, and examines particular keys for certain values to act upon.</description>

      <description>ReactOS Weekly Newsletter Volume 1, Issue 4 Issue 4. A full month of Newsletters, and we&#39;re only just beginning.
ReactOS and other Software I said I&#39;d do this last week, and I&#39;m not one to cut back on a promise.
So, to clarify, ReactOS is an Operating System. What is an Operating System supposed to include? Well, there are several mentalities.
 The Linux Distro Approach. All the software you&#39;d ever need on one DVD, and then some.</description>

      <description>Another Week, Another Newsletter, a lot of news stuffed into a single issue, like an 8-course Barium meal.
A Request! I actually got a request for some content for the newsletter. And since I like the look of them I&#39;ll have a look at both subjects. Let us begin.
New Voting System It was decided a while back that the voting procedures needed to be changed, after a slight mis-hap on IRC, and some questioning the validity of a vote conducted there, as opposed to the Ros-Dev Mailing List.</description>

      <description>New mailing list search! The ability to search the mailing lists with Google wasn&#39;t enough for me so I&#39;ve created a new more flexible mailing list search. This is available under http://www.reactos.org/mlsearch/
We also decided to change the voting system. Now votes are done on the forum instead of the mailing list. This way we can do anonymous votes and keep track of the many decisions that must be made. Greetings Michael Wirth</description>

      <description>Well, would you look at that. Another Sunday. another Newsletter. And Boy has this week been interesting.
The ReactOS Constitution Found here, the new ReactOS Constitution is designed to clarify many of the things we all took for granted, such as who can do what on the project, and to elaborate on how Voting Prodecures should be followed. In addition, it also lays out the responsibilities of all the members of the Board of Directors of the ReactOS Foundation.</description>

      <description>The Big Intro Ah, Hello There! Allow me introduce myself. My name is Stuart Robbins, and my job on Reactos.org, is to write a newsletter, each week, giving you, the End User, and even Casual Developer, the run-down on what is going on behind the scenes, with the ReactOS Open-Source Operating System.
The ReactOS Content Management System First off, is the new ReactOS.org Content Management System, abbreviated RosCMS. It blends in nicely with the ReactOS Wiki (Itself using MediaWiki), while also providing space for new Website Articles (Much like this one), as well as providing small subsections, to announce news, like 0.</description>

      <title>ReactOS at Linux World Expo UK</title>

      <description>On 05th and 06th October, ReactOS attended Linux World Expo UK as part of the .Org village. The two representatives for the project were Ge van Geldorp and Ged Murphy.

Equipment for the exhibition consisted of 3 laptops, one running ReactOS on real hardware, one running ReactOS in VMWare and a laptop to act as an internet gateway. We also had around 100 live CDs and 400 flyers.
Unfortunately we had trouble holding a connection to the AP due to a weak signal, so couldn&#39;t report in real-time.</description>

      <description>WaxDragon took a look at what happened in ReactOS during September The stats:
In Sepember, there were:
578 commits
98 bugs opened
94 bugs closed
I wasn&#39;t able to determine the bugs that weere touched during the last month, since something made *all* bugs appear touched.
A little change of format, I will review the closed bugs first, then go over the SVN commits in less detail than last month.</description>

      <description>New ReactOS Homepage is online! The new ReactOS homepage is now (2005-09-29) online!
The website moved to www.reactos.org as the primary name, with www.reactos.com being an alias (you&#39;ll be redirected automatically to www.reactos.org if you use the old name).
The mailing lists are also going to be moved from reactos.com to reactos.org, so if you have filtering in place please take this into account.
Many thanks to Ge van Geldorp, Michael Wirth and especially Klemens Friedl who put a lot of effort in the new site.</description>
